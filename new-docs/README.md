## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── content/
│   │   └── docs/
│   └── content.config.ts
├── astro.config.mjs
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |

| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |

## Writing Docs

Starlight supports two file types: .md and .mdx

You can use .md for simpler files, but if you need to use imports, then you have to use .mdx. MDX is a file type that mixes js and markdown allowing you do fun things like importing components, doing for loops, functions and all that jazz.

Note that if you use .mdx files, id attributes like {#new-id} will not work, and have to be replaced by ||#new-id|| or \{#new-id\}
