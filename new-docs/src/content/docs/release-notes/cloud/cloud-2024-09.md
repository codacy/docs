# Cloud September 2024

These release notes are for the Codacy Cloud updates during September 2024.

📢 [Visit the Codacy roadmap](https://roadmap.codacy.com) and <span class="skip-vale">let us know</span> your feedback on both new and planned product updates!

## Product enhancements
-  Jscpd supports new languages: Rust, CoffeeScript, Objective C, Elixir, Groovy, and VisualBasic (TCE-1021)
-  The issue card now shows next to the code pattern, the source of the configuration requiring that pattern: repository rules, coding standards, or configuration file (ALA-1231)
-  When applying multiple coding standards to the same repository, if a conflict between parameters in the same enforced pattern is found, it shows a warning on the repository code patterns page (ALA-1232)
-  In the repository code patterns show a tooltip in enforced tools and patterns with the names of the Coding Standards that require those tools or patterns (ALA-1230)
-  Revamped coverage: deleted old coverage pages and added a new repository page for coverage with new insights (CY-7340)
-  Changed the order by the findings list of SRM are sorted, which means now they're sorted by first detected (TAROT-2822)
-  Readability improvements in the tooltip of the 'Open findings (last 3 months)' chart in the SRM tab (TAROT-2825)
-  Added new field with open findings of the current week on the first widget of SRM overview page (TAROT-2823)

## Bug fixes
-  Fixed a problem where an analysis could have extra Patterns enabled when using a coding standard alongside repository-level customizations (ALA-1247)
-  Fixed a bug where some tools could be missing, if 'back' and 'next' actions would be performed multiple times in a row while editing a coding standard (ALA-1239)
-  Fixed an issue where existing DAST findings (in the SRM tab) for a given host would be closed if a DAST report for a different host was submitted (TAROT-2807)
