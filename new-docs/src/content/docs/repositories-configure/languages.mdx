<AdminAccessControlInfo />

Codacy automatically detects and analyzes languages in your repository based on a list of supported file extensions. On the repository **Settings**, tab **Languages**, you can see the list of languages that Codacy detected and will include in the next analysis.

By default, the analysis is enabled for all languages that Codacy detects in you repository. You can adapt this configuration to your needs as follows:

-   [Configure Codacy to include unrecognized extensions](#configuring-file-extensions)
-   [Disable the analysis of specific languages](#disable-language)

:::note
Codacy applies the language settings defined in the Codacy UI as well as any settings defined using a [Codacy configuration file](codacy-configuration-file.md#languages).

## Configuring file extensions

If your repository contains source files with extensions not supported by Codacy, associate these extensions with their respective languages to ensure Codacy analyzes them in the next analysis:

1.  Go to your repository's **Settings**, **Languages**.

1.  Add the extensions you want to be recognized for each language.

1.  Click **Save changes** to update your file extension settings.

    <UpdateFileExtensionsReanalyze />

:::note
Currently, the [Semgrep](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-semgrep) static analysis tool doesn't support custom file extensions.

## Disabling analysis of a language \{#disable-language\}
By default, Codacy analyzes all languages detected in your repository. To disable the analysis of a specific language, do the following:

1.  Go to your repository's **Settings**, **Languages**.

1.  Use the toggle next to the language to disable its analysis.

1.  Click **Save changes** to update your settings.
