## Limitations with Windows

Windows WSL (a feature that allows you to run a Linux environment directly on Windows, without the need for a virtual machine or dual-boot setup) is the only way you can use this feature for now, but we're still working to fully support Windows. Additionally, at this point we're only supporting VSCode and VSCode-based IDEs on Windows.
