<Aside type="caution">
    <p><strong>Never write API tokens to your configuration files</strong> and keep your API tokens well protected, as they grant owner permissions to your projects on Codacy.</p>
    <p>It's a best practice to store API tokens as environment variables. Check the documentation of your CI/CD platform on how to do this.</p>
