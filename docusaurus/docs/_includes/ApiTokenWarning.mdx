        <strong>Never write API tokens to your configuration files</strong> and
        keep your API tokens well protected, as they grant owner permissions to
        your projects on Codacy.

      <p>
        It's a best practice to store API tokens as environment variables. Check
        the documentation of your CI/CD platform on how to do this.
