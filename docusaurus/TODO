MkDocs ➜ Docusaurus migration checklist

Goal: ship `docusaurus/` as the new production site for https://docs.codacy.com/

---
MVP

## 0) Make it beautiful
- [x] Colors, fonts and sizes
- [x] Better footer
- [x] Beautiful navigation
- [x] Nav links

## 0) Apply new theme!
- [ ] Homepage
- [ ] Sidebar
- [ ] Navbar
- [ ] Search
- [ ] Footer
- [ ] Nav buttons
- [ ] Reading time?

## 1) Content parity (docs rendering)
- [ ] Confirm all pages exist in `docusaurus/docs` (count + spot-check key sections)
- [x] Confirm MkDocs-only templating is fully removed from Docusaurus content:
  - [x] No Jinja tags (`{% ... %}` / `{{ ... }}`) remain in `docusaurus/docs`
  - [x] Replace MkDocs `extra.*` variables with Docusaurus equivalents (MDX constants / front matter / config)
- [x] Confirm MkDocs `include-markdown` usage is fully replaced with `_includes/*.mdx` imports/usages
- [x] Confirm admonitions render as expected (MkDocs `!!! note|tip|warning` ➜ Docusaurus admonitions / MDX syntax)
- [ ] Confirm heading IDs/anchors are stable (MkDocs `toc` permalink + custom `{:#id}` usage)

## 2) Navigation & information architecture
- [ ] Review `docusaurus/sidebars.ts` vs MkDocs `nav:` in `mkdocs.yml` for:
  - [ ] Missing/extra categories
  - [ ] Ordering (including release notes yearly grouping)
  - [ ] Any pages that should be hidden from sidebar but still routable
- [x] Replace placeholder site metadata in `docusaurus/docusaurus.config.ts` (title/tagline/footer links/GitHub links)
- [x] Decide canonical doc routes (Docusaurus uses `/` as `routeBasePath`): ensure this matches production expectations

Releseable

## 3) Redirects (must-have before cutover)
- [ ] Port MkDocs `redirect_maps` from `mkdocs.yml` to Docusaurus redirects
  - Recommended: add `@docusaurus/plugin-client-redirects` and generate redirects from `mkdocs.yml`
  - Include legacy Zendesk (`hc/...`) redirects and internal moved-page redirects
- [ ] Validate redirects with a link/redirect checker against the built site

## 5) Release notes specifics
- [ ] RSS feed parity (MkDocs uses `mkdocs-rss-plugin` for `release-notes/*`)
  - [ ] Decide feed generation approach (Docusaurus plugin/custom script during build)
  - [ ] Ensure `/feed_rss_created.xml` exists (many pages link to it)
- [ ] Confirm release notes sidebar + navigation matches expectations (tabs already added)

## 8) SEO & meta descriptions (replaces `mkdocs-meta-descriptions`)
- [ ] Decide how to generate meta descriptions (front matter `description` / plugin / build-time extraction)
- [ ] Preserve sitemap + robots behavior (MkDocs workflow wrote `robots.txt` with sitemap link)
- [ ] Validate canonical URLs and avoid indexing preview builds (MkDocs used preview banner + env toggles)

## 9) CI/CD parity (replaces `.github/workflows/mkdocs.yml`)
- [ ] Add a Docusaurus workflow that covers:
  - [ ] Build
  - [ ] HTML/link validation equivalent to `htmltest` + `lychee` expectations
  - [ ] Branch previews (Netlify or equivalent)
  - [ ] Deploy latest to `gh-pages` with `CNAME=docs.codacy.com`
  - [ ] Deploy versioned Self-hosted docs from `release/v*`

NEXT

## 4) Versioning strategy (replaces `mike` + `MKDOCS_SELF_HOSTED`)
MkDocs currently publishes:
- Latest docs on `master` to `gh-pages/`
- Self-hosted versions from `release/v*` using `mike deploy ...` (and `MKDOCS_SELF_HOSTED=true`)

- [ ] Decide Docusaurus versioning model:
  - [ ] Use Docusaurus docs versions for Self-hosted (`release/v*` ➜ versioned docs)
  - [ ] Decide URL shape for versions (must preserve/redirect existing production URLs)
- [ ] Implement the model in CI (build + deploy) and document how to cut a new Self-hosted version
- [ ] Re-implement any “version selector” behavior (MkDocs `assets/javascripts/version-select.js` + CSS)

## 6) “Last updated” (replaces `git-revision-date-localized`)
- [ ] Enable/verify “Last updated” on doc pages (date + author if desired)
- [ ] Ensure CI checkout uses full git history (`fetch-depth: 0`) so last update data is correct

## 7) Tracking, scripts, and UX widgets
MkDocs uses `extra.segment_key`, `extra.user_feedback`, and custom JS/CSS.
- [ ] Add tracking (Segment or chosen tool) to Docusaurus
- [ ] Add Zendesk
- [ ] Re-implement “user feedback” if it was a widget on MkDocs

## 10) Cleanup & documentation for contributors
- [ ] Update root `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` for Docusaurus (build/preview instructions)
- [ ] Decide what to do with MkDocs artifacts once cutover is complete:
  - [ ] `mkdocs.yml`, `requirements.txt`, MkDocs workflows
  - [ ] MkDocs theme submodule `submodules/codacy-mkdocs-material`

## 11) Update release script
- [ ] Update release script
