# Notifications

You can configure which repositories you want to be emailed about and
your default email to receive the notifications. When new results are
found, Codacy will email you regarding the issues found and the changes
that created them. To change these settings navigate to
<https://www.codacy.com/account/notifications>.

To disable any repository notifications, you can either remove all
repositories or remove both commit and pull requests notifications
globally.
