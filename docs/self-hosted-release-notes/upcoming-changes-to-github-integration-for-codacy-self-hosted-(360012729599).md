# Upcoming changes to GitHub integration for Codacy Self-hosted

We are changing the way you authenticate to Codacy with GitHub: Starting
with the next version, you'll be prompted to configure GitHub Apps.

 

GitHub Apps are the new preferred way of building products that work
with GitHub repositories. Unlike right now, where you must grant access
to everything in your account, with Apps you'll be able to select which
accounts, organizations and repositories Codacy has access to. You can
also grant access to more later. If you previously wanted to grant
access to only one of your organizations or only a specific repository,
Apps will have you covered.

Using Apps also unlocks access to new APIs, like GitHub Checks for
creating better pull request reviews.

 

Despite the integration with existing repositories continuing to work,
the following steps will be required:

1.  Codacy Admin: [Create and configure a new GitHub
    App](/hc/en-us/articles/360012665460)
2.  GitHub organization Admin: Install the new App in the organization
3.  All GitHub users: When signing in, grant access with the new App
