# Generate Coverage

Code coverage is a metric used to describe the degree to which the
source code of a program is tested.

A program with high code coverage has been more thoroughly tested and
has a lower chance of containing software bugs than a program with low
code coverage.

There are many tools to generate coverage. We have a few suggestions:

-   Java - [JaCoCo](http://eclemma.org/jacoco)
-   JavaScript - [Istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul)
-   PHP - [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de)
-   Python - [Coverage.py](http://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
-   C\# - [OpenCover](https://github.com/OpenCover/opencover/) and
    [dotCover](https://www.jetbrains.com/dotcover/)
-   Scala -
    [Scoverage](https://github.com/scoverage/scalac-scoverage-plugin)
-   Ruby - [SimpleCov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov)
