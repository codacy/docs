# Coverage

 

## **How to set coverage up**

For the next steps, we assume you already have tests and coverage for
your repository. If you don't have coverage and need help, take a look
at our
[article](https://support.codacy.com/hc/en-us/articles/207312879-Generate-Coverage)
on how to generate coverage.

<span style="text-align: center;">Repositories can be configured to show
code coverage reports directly in Codacy. Codacy reads the source
coverage reports, converts them to a smaller JSON file and uploads them,
showing all results integrated into your [repository's
dashboard](https://support.codacy.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003890673-Project-Dashboard-How-does-it-work-).</span>

 

## **Project API Token**

To set up coverage reporting you'll need a Project API token. You can
find it in your repository settings 'Integrations' tab.

###  

### <span class="ng-binding">Token Security</span>

You should keep your API token well protected, as it grants owner
permissions to your repositories. If you use CircleCI or Travis CI, you
should use your token as an environment variable. **Don't put your keys
in your configuration files**, check your service settings on how to set
environment variables.

 

### <span class="ng-binding">Setting token as environment variable</span>

export CODACY\_PROJECT\_TOKEN=%Project\_Token%

(replacing %Project\_Token% with your token)

 

## **Setup**

Check [here](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-coverage-reporter#setup)
for detailed instructions on how to set up the coverage reporter plugin.

 

## **Submitting coverage for unsupported languages or tools **

If your language or build tool isn't supported yet, you can send the
coverage data directly through the Codacy API. You can check the
endpoint in the [API
documentation](https://api.codacy.com/swagger#savecoverage) and an
example of the JSON payload below.

    {
      "total": 23,
      "fileReports": [
        {
          "filename": "src/Codacy/Coverage/Parser/CloverParser.php",
          "total": 54,
          "coverage": {
            "3": 3,
            "5": 0,
            "7": 1
          }
        }
      ]
    }

Note: In case the token was retrieved from the Repository integrations
tab, the header should be `project_token`. If it is an account token,
the header should be `api_token` and you must call [this API
method](https://api.codacy.com/swagger#savecoveragewithprojectname)
instead.

Also, note all *coverable* lines should be present on the "coverage"
variable of the JSON payload. In the example, you can see that "5": 0,
meaning that line 5 is not covered.
