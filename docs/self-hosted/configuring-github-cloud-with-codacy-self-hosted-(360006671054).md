Configuring GitHub Cloud allows you to easily add GitHub repositories to
your Self-hosted installation.

To get started, navigate to the **Integrations** page in the
Administration view and select **GitHub Cloud**.

First, you'll have to create a GitHub OAuth application. [Create an
application here](https://github.com/settings/applications/new).

Fill all the fields with the text shown in the image below or use your
own text except for the field *Authorization callback URL,* where you
must insert your local Codacy deployment URL.

The URL should contain the endpoint/IP, the protocol (HTTP or HTTPS)
and, if applicable, the port where it is running.

Correct:

-   [http://your.codacy.url.com](http://your.codacy.url.com/)
-   [http://your.codacy.url.com:9000](http://your.codacy.url.com:9000/)
-   [http://53.43.42.12](http://53.43.42.12/)
-   [http://53.43.42.12:9000](http://53.43.42.12:9000/)

Incorrect:

-   your.codacy.url.com
-   your.codacy.url.com:9000
-   53.43.42.12
-   53.43.42.12:9000

After the application is created you should copy both the *Client ID*
and the *Client Secret*, paste them in the setup page of your Codacy
Self-hosted, and click Test and Save.
