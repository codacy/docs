# GitLab integration - Codacy Self-hosted

After adding a repository, you may want to enable GitLab integration to comment on commits, create issues, and more.

To do so, navigate to your **Repository Settings**, and select the **Integrations** tab. The installation takes one click, but you may have to move back and forth between Codacy and GitLab if additional permissions are required.

After GitLab has been installed, it needs to be enabled by a user with repository access on GitLab. For private repositories, this user will by default become the GitLab user Codacy uses to comment and create issues on GitLab.
