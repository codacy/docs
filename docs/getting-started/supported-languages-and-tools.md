# Supported languages and tools

For each supported programming language, Codacy generally provides Static Analysis, Code Duplication, Code Complexity, and Test Coverage.

The following table lists all programming languages currently supported by Codacy and the tools that Codacy uses to analyze your source code. You can also see the [list of supported test coverage reports](../coverage-reporter/adding-coverage-to-your-repository.md).

## Codacy plugin tools

Codacy uses a system of plugin tools to extend the scope of analyses on your repositories, allowing support for new tools and languages every day. To create your own tool, check the [tool developer guide](../related-tools/tool-developer-guide.md).

Our GitHub repositories list the version being used for each tool as well as additional plugins that we support for each tool.
