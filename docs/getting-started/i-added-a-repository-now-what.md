# I added a repository. Now what?

Codacy begins an initial analysis as soon as you add a repository and sends you an email notification once the first analysis is completed.

![Repository dashboard](../repositories/images/repository-dashboard.png)

After the first analysis is complete you can continue to explore and configure Codacy for your repository:

-   [Check the static analysis results](../repositories/issues-view.md) on the Issues page
-   [Configure the code patterns](../repositories-configure/code-patterns.md) that Codacy uses to analyze your repository
-   [Configure your quality settings](../repositories/quality-settings.md) for pull requests
-   [Add coverage reports to Codacy](/coverage-reporter/)
-   [Add a Codacy badge to your repository](../repositories/badges.md) displaying the current code quality grade or code coverage
