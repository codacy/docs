# I added a repository. Now what?

Codacy begins an initial analysis as soon as you add a repository, and displays an overview of the code quality of your repository when the analysis is complete.

After that, you can continue to explore and configure Codacy for your repository:

-   [Check the static analysis results](../repositories/issues-view.md) on the Issues page
-   [Configure the code patterns](../repositories-configure/code-patterns.md) that Codacy uses to analyze your repository
-   [Configure your quality settings](../repositories/quality-settings.md) for pull requests
-   [Add coverage reports to Codacy](../coverage-reporter/adding-coverage-to-your-repository.md)
-   [Add a Codacy badge to your repository](../repositories/badges.md) displaying the current code quality grade or code coverage
