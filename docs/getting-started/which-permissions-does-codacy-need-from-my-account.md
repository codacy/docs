# Which permissions does Codacy need from my account?

Codacy Cloud uses the OAuth protocol to handle logins and supports the following providers:

-   [GitHub Cloud](#github-cloud)
-   [GitLab Cloud](#gitlab-cloud)
-   [Bitbucket Cloud](#bitbucket-cloud)
-   [Google Sign-In](#google-sign-in)

Codacy requests only the necessary permissions from your Git provider to analyze your code and [keeps your information secure](https://security.codacy.com/). See the sections below for the detailed list of permissions that Codacy asks for depending on the provider.

## GitHub Cloud

If you log in with GitHub, Codacy requires the following [app permissions](https://developer.github.com/v3/apps/permissions/):

## GitLab Cloud

## Google Sign-In

If you log in with Google, Codacy requires the `email` [scope](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes#google-sign-in).

## Revoking access to integrations

To revoke the access from Codacy to one or more of the OAuth providers:

1.  Click on your avatar on the top right-hand corner and select **Your Account**, tab **Access Management**.
1.  The **Access Management** page lists all current integrations with Git providers or Google that you used to sign in or log in to Codacy. To revoke access to an integration, click the button **Revoke access** for the intended integration.

    ![Revoking access to an integration](images/revoke-integration.png)

1.  To ensure that the integration is removed not only on Codacy but also on the integration side, we recommend that you follow the instructions on how to revoke the Codacy OAuth application on your provider:

    -   [GitHub Cloud](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/reviewing-your-authorized-integrations)
    -   [GitLab Cloud](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html#authorized-applications)
    -   [Bitbucket Cloud](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/bitbucket-cloud-apps-overview/#OAuth-consumer-permissions)
    -   [Google Sign-in](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3466521#remove-access)

After revoking an integration, Codacy will no longer be able to access or manipulate resources that require API calls, such as detecting new pull requests or adding comments to pull requests. However, Codacy will still be able to perform operations that only require using the Git protocol either via SSH or HTTPS, such as detecting new commits and calculating diffs. To remove your repositories from Codacy and stop the analysis you must [delete them from your Codacy account](../repositories-configure/removing-your-repository.md).

If you need to use an integration that you have previously revoked, log in again to Codacy with that integration so that Codacy can request the required permissions from the provider.

## Why does Codacy ask for permission to create SSH keys?

Codacy asks for permission to create SSH keys because it needs to create an SSH key in your account in the following situations:

-   If your repository uses submodules, so that Codacy can clone the repositories for each submodule
-   If Codacy fails to integrate with a repository using the repository key, so that Codacy can continue to perform analysis

**Codacy only adds read-only SSH keys to be able to clone repositories** and won't have access to any of your existing SSH keys. You have full control over which organizations and repositories Codacy is authorized to access, and you can also [revoke the keys created by Codacy at any time](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/reviewing-your-ssh-keys). Codacy doesn't change the contents or member privileges of any repository you authorize it to analyze.

We understand the desire for security and privacy and find that the SSH protocol is preferable to HTTPS as it separates Codacy's access rights from the one of the users.
