# Setting up your personal repositories

The [onboarding wizard](getting-started-with-codacy.md) guides you through importing repositories from your Git provider to Codacy Organizations. However, you may also want to add your personal repositories that do not belong to any Organization to Codacy.

## Setting up a personal repository

If you are logged in to Codacy through a Git provider account, you should be presented with a list of repositories when you click on the **Add repository** button at the top of the repositories screen.

After finding your repositories, click the button **Add** next to each repository that you want to add to Codacy. Your repositories are now imported, and a first analysis will begin.

Using the links on the sidebar It is also possible to import repositories from other Git providers, or to import private repositories if you’re using GitHub.
