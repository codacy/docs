# Which permissions does Codacy need from my account?

Codacy Cloud uses [OAuth](https://oauth.net/) to handle logins. We support the following providers:

- GitHub Cloud
- GitLab Cloud
- Bitbucket Cloud
- Google Sign-In

Depending on the provider, we may request different permissions due to different OAuth implementations. We strive to request only the necessary permissions.

## GitHub Cloud

If you log in with GitHub, Codacy requires the following [permissions/scopes](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-integrations/setting-up-and-registering-oauth-apps/about-scopes-for-oauth-apps/):

- 'user' permissions to access GitHub user info
- 'public\_repo' permissions to set PR status on public repositories
- 'repo' access to access private repositories
- 'write: public\_key' to add SSH keys to the repositories, so that
    Codacy can have access to the repository
- 'write:repo\_hook' access to add post-commit hooks
- 'read:org': read-only access to organization membership,
    organization repositories, and team membership
- 'admin:org\_hook' to access organization hooks

- ‘read\_user’ permissions to read the authenticated user's personal information
- ‘read\_repository’ permissions to read the repositories

## Revoking access to integrations

To revoke the access from Codacy to one or more of the OAuth providers:

1. Open your Profile page on Codacy by clicking on your avatar and selecting **Your Account**.

2. The Profile page lists all current integrations with Git providers or Google that you used to sign in or log in to Codacy. To revoke the access to an integration, click the button **Revoke** next to the intended integration.

    ![Revoking an integration](/images/revoke-2.png)

3. To ensure that the integration is removed not only on Codacy but also on the integration side, we recommend that you follow the instructions on how to revoke the Codacy OAuth application on your provider:
    - [GitHub Cloud](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/reviewing-your-authorized-integrations)
    - [GitLab Cloud](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html#authorized-applications)
    - [Bitbucket Cloud](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/bitbucket-cloud-apps-979433330.html#BitbucketCloudapps-OAuthconsumerpermissions)
    - [Google Sign-in](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3466521#remove-access)

After revoking an integration, Codacy will no longer be able to access or manipulate resources that require API calls, such as detecting new pull requests or adding comments to pull requests. However, Codacy will continue to be able to perform operations that only require using the Git protocol either via SSH or HTTPS, such as detecting new commits and calculating diffs. To unregister your repositories from Codacy and stop the analysis you must [delete them from your Codacy account](/hc/en-us/articles/207994835-How-do-I-transfer-delete-a-repository-from-my-account-).

If you need to use an integration that you have previously revoked, log in again to Codacy with that integration so that Codacy can request the required permissions from the provider.
