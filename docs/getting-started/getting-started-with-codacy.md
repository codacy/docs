# Getting started with Codacy

Codacy automatically identifies issues through static code review analysis and notifies you on security issues, code coverage, code duplication, and code complexity in every commit and pull request.

To get started, head to [codacy.com](https://www.codacy.com/) and click **Get started**.

## 1. Sign up

Signing up with a Git provider such as GitHub links your Codacy user with your Git provider user, making it easier to add repositories to Codacy and invite your teammates.

Youâ€™ll be prompted to allow Codacy access to your Git provider during the authorization flow. Read more aboutÂ [the permissions Codacy requires and why](/hc/en-us/articles/115003405529).

## 2. Account Details

Youâ€™ll be asked to fill in a few details about your company so we know a bit more about your use case.

## 3. Choose an organization

Now, youâ€™ll need to select the organization that contains your repositories. If you canâ€™t see the organization you are looking for, [read this troubleshooting page](/hc/en-us/articles/360010264500).

The selected organization will then be synced with Codacy so that managing your team permissions is easy. Read more about [what synced organizations do](/hc/en-us/articles/360010263720).

## 4. Add repositories

And as a final step, you can select the repositories that you wish to analyze. Codacy will start the first analysis and set up everything required to ensure your next commits on those repositories are analyzed.

## 5. You're all set!Â  ðŸŽ‰
