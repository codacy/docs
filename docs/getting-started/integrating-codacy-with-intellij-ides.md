# Integrating Codacy with IntelliJ IDEs

The [Codacy IntelliJ plugin](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-intellij-extension) is an open-source plugin for IntelliJ IDEs that lets you review the result of the Codacy analysis for a pull request, get the full list of problems found, and navigate to any issue that you want to review and fix.

!!! info "To use this plugin you need a [Codacy account](https://www.codacy.com/signup-codacy)"

## Interface overview

The main view of the Codacy IntelliJ plugin provides a summary of the code quality and coverage changes introduced by the pull request of the currently checked-out branch.

![Main view](./images/codacy-intellij-plugin-main-view.png)

In the main view, you can find the following information:

-   The **Status** of the pull request, either up to standards or not up to standards, based on the [Gates](../repositories-configure/adjusting-quality-gates.md) set for the repository.

-   Any **issues** introduced or fixed by the pull request. These are the same issues you find in the [Issues tabs](../repositories/pull-requests.md#issues-tabs) in the Codacy app and are also visible in IntelliJ's Problems tab.

    When this item is expanded, the number next to each file name is the total number of issues that the pull request adds to that file.

-   The **diff coverage** introduced by the pull request. The percentage next to each file name is the coverage variation for that file.

-   Sequences of **duplicate code** (clones) introduced by the pull request. These are the same ones you find in the [Duplication tabs](../repositories/pull-requests.md#duplication-tabs) in the Codacy app.

-   Variations in **code complexity** introduced by the pull request.

## Installing the Codacy IntelliJ plugin

!!! info "The Codacy IntelliJ plugin is compatible with IntelliJ IDEA (Ultimate, Community), Android Studio, and Aqua."

1.  Make sure that the repository you’re working on is analyzed by Codacy and that you have a [repository read](../organizations/roles-and-permissions-for-organizations.md) role or higher.

    !!! tip
        If this is your first time using Codacy, see [how to add and analyze your first repository](./codacy-quickstart.md#adding-your-first-repository).

1.  Install the plugin from the [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/23924-codacy) or through the [plugin settings panel](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/managing-plugins.html) in your IntelliJ IDE.

## Getting pull request quality and coverage data

To see Codacy quality and coverage data for an open pull request, follow these steps:

1.  Open the repository directory in your IntelliJ IDE.

    !!! note
        If the repository isn't on Codacy yet, [add it to Codacy](../organizations/managing-repositories.md#adding-a-repository) first.

1.  Open the main view by clicking the **Codacy logo** in the left tool window bar.

    ![Codacy main view](./images/codacy-intellij-plugin-sign-in.png)

1.  If you’re not signed in, click the **Sign in** button to authorize IntelliJ on Codacy.

1.  Check out the pull request of interest.

After completing these steps, the main view shows the result of the latest Codacy analysis for the pull request.

## Reviewing pull request issues

In the **Problems tool window**, Codacy displays the same issues you find in the main view and lets you navigate to the exact line of code where the issue was found.

!!! note
    Code coverage, duplicates, and complexity aren't currently shown in the Problems tool window.

To review issues:

1.  Open the file you want to review.

    You can find the list of files with issues in the main view of the Codacy plugin. Double-click the file name to open it in the editor.

1.  Open the **Problems tool window** (use `Ctrl+6` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+6` on macOS) and select the **File** tab.

    ![Navigate to a specific issue from the Problems tab](./images/codacy-intellij-plugin-problems-tab.png)

1.  Click the name of the issue you want to review.

1.  Hover over a highlighted issue in the code editor to view available actions and suggested quick fixes, if available.

    For a list of tools that support suggested fixes, see [Supported languages and tools](./supported-languages-and-tools.md#supported-languages-and-tools).

1.  Once you've addressed the problems in your code, push your changes to the Git provider so that Codacy analyzes the updated code.

When the analysis is complete, the Codacy plugin automatically refreshes the pull request analysis result. You can also refresh the pull request data manually by clicking the Refresh Pull Request button in the main view.
