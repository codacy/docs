## Supported categories

-   **XSS:** XSS enables attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
-   **Input validation:** Input not validated may originate SQL Injection attacks for instance.
-   **File access:** An attacker may use special paths to access files that should not be accessible.
-   **HTTP:** HTTP headers are a common attack vector for malign users.
-   **Cookies:** An HTTP cookie is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer by the browser while the user is browsing.
-   **Unexpected behaviour:** Assigning values to private APIs might lead to unexpected behaviour.
-   **Mass assignment:** Mass assignment is a feature of Rails which allows an application to create a record from the values of a hash.
-   **Insecure storage:** Storing sensitive data using this APIs is not safe.
-   **Insecure modules/libraries:** Consider possible security implications associated with some modules.
-   **Visibility:** Fields should not have public accessibility.
-   **CSRF:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they're currently authenticated.
-   **Android:** Android specific issues.
-   **Malicious code:** Exposed internal APIs can be accessed or change changed by malicious code or by accident from another package.
-   **Cryptography:** Cryptography is a security technique widely used and there are several cryptographic functions, but not all of them are secure.
-   **Command injection:** Command injection is an attack in which the goal is the execution of arbitrary commands on the host operating system.
-   **Firefox OS:** Sensitive APIs of Firefox OS.
-   **Auth:** Authentication is present in almost all web applications nowadays.
-   **DoS:** The Denial of Service (DoS) attack is focused on making a resource (site, application, server) unavailable for the purpose it was designed.
-   **SQL injection:** A SQL injection attack consists of insertion or 'injection' of a SQL query via the input data from the client to the application.
-   **Routes:** Badly configured routes can give unintended access to an attacker.
-   **Regex:** Regex can be used in a Denial of Service attack, that exploits the fact that most Regular Expression implementations may reach heavy computation situations that cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size).
-   **SSL:** Simply using SSL isn't enough to ensure the data you are sending is secure. Man in the middle attacks are well known and widely used.
-   **Other:** Other language specific security issues.

## Category states

Each security category listed on the left-hand side of the dashboard has one of four states:

|                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![Green](https://support.codacy.com/hc/article_attachments/360008851559/green.png)   | A green check mark means that **everything is OK** for this category: all the security patterns in this category are enabled, and no security issues have been found.                                            |
| ![Yellow](https://support.codacy.com/hc/article_attachments/360008851660/yellow.png) | A yellow exclamation mark means that **there are security patterns in this category that are disabled**. You should enable the patterns in this category so it is verified.                                      |
| ![Red](https://support.codacy.com/hc/article_attachments/360008851579/red.png)       | A red cross means that **there are security issues identified** for this category.                                                                                                                               |
|                                                                                      | A blue info icon means that **Codacy cannot be sure if you have all the security patterns in this category enabled**. This happens when you are using configuration files to control which patterns are enabled. |


## Additional features

On the Security dashboard view you can also:

-   Enable all the security patterns for that repository with one click 
-   Download all the patterns in a CSV file (this will give you a list of all the patterns considered by Codacy under the security category)

You just have to go to your repository's Security Tab, click on <img src="https://support.codacy.com/hc/article_attachments/360012987454/morebutton.png" width="80" height="32" alt="morebutton.png" /> and select the relevant option.
