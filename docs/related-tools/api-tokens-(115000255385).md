# API Tokens

API Tokens allow you authenticate when using the Codacy API. You must
generate an API Token and include it in the headers of your API calls as
described on the [Codacy API
documentation](https://api.codacy.com/swagger#authentication).

To generate an API Token, go to your **Account Settings** and click on
the tab **API Tokens**. Codacy generates a new API token every time you
click the button **Generate token**.

To revoke access to the Codacy API, you must remove the corresponding
API Token from the list. After this, all applications or services using
that token to access the Codacy API will fail to authenticate and will
receive the following error reply:

    {"error":"not found"}

To send coverage for your repository, you need the [Project API
token](https://support.codacy.com/hc/en-us/articles/207279819-Coverage).
