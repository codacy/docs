# Setting up your personal repositories

The [onboarding
wizard](/hc/en-us/articles/360010263540-Getting-started-with-Codacy)
guides you through importing repositories from your Git provider to
Codacy Organizations. However, you may also want to add your personal
repositories that do not belong to any Organization to Codacy.

If you are logged in to Codacy through a Git provider account, you
should be presented with a list of repositories when you click on the
**Add repository** button at the top of the repositories screen.

After finding your repositories, click the button **Add** next to each
repository that you want to add to Codacy. Your repositories are now
imported, and a first analysis will begin.
