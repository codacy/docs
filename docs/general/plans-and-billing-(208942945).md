# Plans and Billing

## **How does the 14-day trial work?**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sign up with your Git provider or Google account (no credit card
required), and enjoy the full functionalities of Codacy for 14 days.
After the trial period, you can either upgrade to a paid plan to enjoy
Codacy with unlimited private repositories, or do nothing and stick with
the free plan for open source repositories.

## **How many users do I need to have in my organization?**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Users are developers contributing to the repository and any team member
with access to the code analysis results on the Codacy UI. Your
organization should have as many users as your repositories have
contributors.

please
