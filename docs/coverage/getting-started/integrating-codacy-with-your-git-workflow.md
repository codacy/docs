# [Coverage] Integrating Codacy with your Git workflow

<!--TODO {--% include-markdown "../assets/includes/nav-multistep-quickstart.md" %--}-->

Once you've configured your repository to best match your use case, integrate Codacy with your Git workflow to display code coverage metrics and status checks on your pull requests.

In particular, you can configure coverage gates to block merging pull requests that don't meet the coverage standards of your team. This ensures the code coverage of the changes to your codebase, preventing the introduction of untested code.

To integrate Codacy with your Git workflow, follow these steps:

1.  [Configuring the coverage gate rules](#configuring-gate)
1.  [Activating the Git provider integration](#git-provider-integration)
1.  [Blocking merging pull requests](#blocking-pull-requests) (optional)

## 1. Configuring the coverage gate rules {: id="configuring-gate"}

[Review and adjust the coverage gates](../../repositories-configure/adjusting-quality-gates.md) of your repository to decide which pull requests should fail the Codacy coverage gate.

!!! tip
    The default value for the coverage gate rules are designed to help maintain the current code coverage of your repository and might be demanding. Depending on factors such as the current code coverage of your repository and the maturity of your team practices, consider the balance between implementing stricter coverage gates and the possibility of delaying or blocking the development progress.

    Codacy generally recommends that on a first stage you configure rules that focus on preventing considerable drops in code coverage.

## 2. Activating the Git provider integration {: id="git-provider-integration"}

Follow the instructions for [GitHub](../../repositories-configure/integrations/github-integration.md#enabling), [GitLab](../../repositories-configure/integrations/gitlab-integration.md#enabling), or [Bitbucket](../../repositories-configure/integrations/bitbucket-integration.md#enabling) depending on your Git provider, and make sure that you:

1.  Enable the Git provider integration
1.  Enable the option **Status checks** (GitHub) or **Pull request status** (GitLab and Bitbucket)

## 3. Blocking merging pull requests (optional) {: id="blocking-pull-requests"}

Once you've tested out Codacy for a while and you're happy with the level of feedback provided, you can decide to enforce the coverage gates and use Codacy to block merging pull requests on your Git provider. This is the best way to protect your code from unwelcome changes and fully integrates coverage analysis into your development pipeline.

!!! important
    To eliminate any false positives that could inadvertently block the work of your team, it's important that before activating this feature you:

    -   Validate that Codacy is reporting the intended status on your pull requests
    -   Double check you repository's [coverage gate settings](../../repositories-configure/adjusting-quality-gates.md)

Follow the instructions from your Git provider to block merging pull requests if they don't pass the Codacy status check:

-   **GitHub:** [set Codacy as a required status check](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/managing-a-branch-protection-rule)
-   **GitLab:** [only allow merge requests to be merged if the pipeline succeeds](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/merge_when_pipeline_succeeds.html#only-allow-merge-requests-to-be-merged-if-the-pipeline-succeeds)
-   **Bitbucket:** [configure Bitbucket to prevent a merge with unresolved merge checks](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/suggest-or-require-checks-before-a-merge/)

## You're all set! ðŸŽ‰

**Congratulations!** You've successfully integrated and set up your first repository.
