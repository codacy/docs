# Why can't I configure post-commit hooks and integrations?

Have you added your repository manually (via URL)? In that case, Codacy
won't allow the integration to be added, causing the issue with
post-commit hooks. To get this sorted, you will have to remove your
repository and re-add it via our wizard page.  

If you are still unable to configure the integration, please email us at
<support@codacy.com>.
