# GitLab integration

The GitLab integration incorporates Codacy on your existing Git provider workflows.

Depending on the configuration of the GitLab integration, Codacy can report and notify you about issues directly on your merge requests.

## Enabling the GitLab integration {: id="enabling"}

To enable the GitLab integration, open your project **Settings**, tab **Integrations**. When you add a new repository, the integration is already enabled by default.

1.  Click the button **Add integration** and select **GitLab** on the list.
1.  Click the button **Enable** and follow the instructions.

    !!! important
        The user that enables the integration must have administrator access to the repository.

## Configuring the GitLab integration

To configure the GitLab integration, open your project **Settings**, tab **Integrations**.

Depending on the options that you enable, Codacy will automatically update merge requests on GitLab with extra information when accepting merge requests:

### Pull Request Status

Adds a report to your merge requests showing whether your merge requests and coverage are up to standards or not as configured on the [quality settings](../../repositories-configure/quality-settings.md) of your project. To see the coverage status, ensure that you enable the option **Coverage** in the quality settings.
