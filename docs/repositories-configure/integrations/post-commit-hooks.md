# Post-commit hooks

When you add a new repository to Codacy, Codacy automatically creates a repository hook on your Git provider to check for new commits and pull requests. This post-commit hook enables Codacy to trigger an analysis to run immediately after you push code to your repository.

!!! important
    Don't change the configuration of the hooks created by Codacy on your Git provider, as it might cause service failure.

## Creating a new post-commit hook

In case your repositoryâ€™s hook is missing from your Git provider, you can create a new one:

1.  Open your repository **Settings**, tab **Integrations**.
1.  On the **Post-commit hook** area, click the button **Create new hook**.
