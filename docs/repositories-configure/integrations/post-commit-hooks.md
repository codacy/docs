# Post-commit hooks

<!--TODO CY-6642 This page needs a complete review-->

For Codacy to check updates in your repository (new commits and pull requests) you must have post-commit hooks enabled.

There are two ways to do this: **automatically** or **manually**

## Automatic setup of post-commit hook

If you're using GitHub or Bitbucket you can let Codacy configure the hook for you. Go to your **repository settings** and click on the **Integrations** tab. There should be a switch button for the automatic setup of post-commit hooks.

### Missing hook automatic setup switch button

If the switch isn't visible, go to the **Integrations** tab and add the GitHub or Bitbucket integration.

    Make sure that you enable the integration after adding it.
