description: Enable the GitHub integration to have status checks, annotations, issue and coverage summaries, and suggested fixes from Codacy directly on pull requests.

# GitHub integration

The GitHub integration incorporates Codacy on your existing Git provider workflows by reporting issues and the analysis status directly on your pull requests.

When you add a new repository, Codacy sets the GitHub integration using the [default settings for your organization](../../organizations/integrations/default-git-provider-integration-settings.md). You can then [customize the settings](#configuring) for the repository.

## Configuring the GitHub integration {: id="configuring"}

To configure the GitHub integration, open your repository **Settings**, tab **Integrations**.

Depending on the options that you enable, Codacy will automatically update pull requests on GitHub with extra information when accepting pull requests.

{%
    include-markdown "../../assets/includes/default-git-provider-settings-tip.md"
    start="<!--default-settings-apply-all-start-->"
    end="<!--default-settings-apply-all-end-->"
%}

### Status checks

Adds a report to your pull requests showing whether your pull requests and coverage are up to standards or not as configured on the [quality gate rules](../../repositories-configure/adjusting-quality-gates.md) for your repository. You can then optionally [block merging pull requests that aren't up to standards](../../getting-started/integrating-codacy-with-your-git-workflow.md#blocking-pull-requests).

{% include-markdown "../../assets/includes/status-checks-important.md" %}

### Issue annotations

Adds annotations on the lines of the pull request where Codacy finds new issues. Codacy maps the severity of the issues reported by the tools to the severity levels of the annotations. To enable this option, you must enable **Status checks** first.

### Issue summaries

Shows an overall view of the changes in the pull request, including new issues and metrics such as complexity and duplication. To enable this option, you must enable **Status checks** first.

### Coverage summaries

Adds a pull request comment showing an overall view of the coverage metrics for the pull request, including details about the data that Codacy used to calculate the coverage variation and diff coverage metrics.

When there are new coverage results, Codacy updates the last coverage summary comment if it's included in the last 5 comments of the pull request. Otherwise, Codacy creates a new comment.

!!! important
    **To get coverage summaries** you must also [add coverage to your repository](../../coverage-reporter/index.md).

!!! note
    This feature is only supported on GitHub Cloud.

### Suggested fixes {: id="suggest-fixes"}

{%
    include-markdown "../../assets/includes/paid.md"
    start="<!--paid-start-->"
    end="<!--paid-end-->"
%}

Adds comments on the lines of the pull request where Codacy finds new issues with suggestions on how to fix the issues. Codacy doesn't apply any changes automatically. To apply the changes, [manually review and accept the suggestions](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request#applying-suggested-changes).

!!! tip
    Enable also **AI-enhanced comments** to get ready-to-commit AI-generated fixes.

### AI-enhanced comments

Adds AI-enhanced comments, providing insights and ready-to-commit AI-generated fixes for identified issues in cases where tool-suggested fixes are not supported. To enable this option, you must enable **Suggested fixes** first.

{% include-markdown "../../assets/includes/ai-info.md" %}

## Generating automatic pull request summaries

!!! info "This is a preview feature"
    This is an upcoming Codacy feature. If you're interested, contact <a href="mailto:support@codacy.com">support@codacy.com</a> for early access.

Codacy can provide a clear, high-level summary of the code changes introduced by a pull request, based on the committed code.
Codacy generates an overview of the changes in the pull request so that any reviewer can understand its intent and impact.

![Automatic Summary on GitHub](images/github-integration-automatic-summary.png)

!!! note
    -   This feature uses only AWS services within Codacy's existing infrastructure. No information is shared with any other third party or used to train AI models.
    -   Summaries are generated using the pull request title, branch name, commit messages, and changes diff.

To enable this feature, add the following to the [Codacy configuration file](../codacy-configuration-file.md) `.codacy.yaml` in the root of your repository:

```yaml
---
reviews:
  high_level_summary: true
```

You can also enable this feature across your organization by creating the above file in the root of a repository named `.codacy`. This file will be used as the default configuration for all repositories in the organization and overridden by repository-specific configuration files.

Once enabled, summaries will be created when pull requests are opened and updated at each commit to reflect any changes to the pull request.

Pull requests opened by bots, such as Dependabot, are ignored.

If you see duplicated comments posted by Codacy on the same pull request, please ensure that your repository only has one configured webhook for Codacy.
