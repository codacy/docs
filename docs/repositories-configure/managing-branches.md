# Managing branches

Codacy supports analysis on multiple branches on your Git repositories.

By default, Codacy automatically triggers analysis on the `master` branch only.

You can define the main branch of your repository on the repository **Settings**, tab **Branches**.

## Pull requests

Upon **pull requests**, Codacy automatically triggers analysis on the corresponding branch to analyze the pull request, **as long as the target branch of the pull request is enabled**.

## Analyzing other branches

It's also possible to enable analysis on other branches.

To do this, open the repository **Settings**, tab **Branches** , and enable the branches that Codacy should analyze.
