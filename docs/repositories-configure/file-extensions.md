# Configuring file extensions

If your repository has source files with unrecognized extensions, you can configure Codacy to include them in the next analysis:

1.  Go to your repository's **Settings**, **File Extensions**.

    ![Configuring file extensions](images/file-extensions.png)<!--TODO Update-->

1.  Add the extensions you want to be recognized for each language.

1.  Click **Save** to update your file extension settings.

    The updated settings will be used on the next analysis, but you can click **reanalyze the latest commit of your branches now** on the notification that appears at the bottom of the page to trigger an analysis immediately.
