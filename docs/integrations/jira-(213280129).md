# JIRA

After adding a repository, you may want to enable JIRA integration, to
manually create issues on your JIRA board. 

To set up, navigate to your repository's **Settings &gt;
Integrations,** fill in all the fields, and click on **Save**.

The integration only support the Basic authentication method. Use your
email as username and an API token as the password. Follow the
instructions to [generate a JIRA API
token](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/Vo71Nw).
