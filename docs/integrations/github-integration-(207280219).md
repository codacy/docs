# GitHub Integration

After adding a repository, navigate to your repository's** Settings
-&gt; Integrations** tab to enable GitHub integration for comments on
pull requests, issue creation, and more.

It installs in just one click but you may need to move back and forth
between Codacy and GitHub if it requires additional permissions.

After installing it for a repository, it has to be enabled by a user
with repository access on GitHub. For private repositories, this user
will by default become the GitHub user that Codacy will use to comment
and create issues on GitHub. For public repositories, comments made by
Codacy will appear as coming from codacy-bot.

Once the integration is enabled, you will see additional options when
browsing the existing issues on the repository:
