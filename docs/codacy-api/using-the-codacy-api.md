# Using the Codacy API

The Codacy API allows you to programmatically retrieve and analyze data from Codacy and perform a few configuration changes.

Codacy supports two API versions but we strongly recommend using the new API v3 when possible since it's the version being actively developed:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <th><strong>API v3 (recommended)</strong></th>
      <th><strong>API v2</strong></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>

!!! important
    **If you're using Codacy Self-hosted** you must update the base URL of the APIs to include your Codacy instance domain name. For example:

    ```
    https://codacy.example.com/api/v3
    ```

## Authenticating requests to the Codacy API

Most API endpoints require that you provide either a [project or account API token](api-tokens.md). After obtaining the necessary tokens, include them in your request headers using the format `api-token: <your account API token>` or `project-token: <your project API token>`.

For example, to make a request to an API v3 endpoint that requires an **account API token**:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.codacy.com/api/v3/user/organizations/gh' \
     -H 'api-token: <your account API token>'
```

Or to make a request to an API v2 endpoint that requires a **project API token**:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.codacy.com/2.0/commit/da275c14ffab6e402dcc6009828067ffa44b7ee0' \
     -H 'project-token: <your project API token>'
```

## Using parameters in requests

Most API endpoints require that you specify parameters.

**For `GET` requests**, specify parameters directly as path segments of the endpoint URLs. Some endpoints also accept optional query string parameters.

For example, to call the endpoint [getRepositoryWithAnalysis](https://api.codacy.com/api/api-docs#getrepositorywithanalysis) with the parameters:

-   provider: `gh`
-   remoteOrganizationName: `codacy`
-   repositoryName: `docs`
-   branch (query string): `api-overview`

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://app.codacy.com/api/v3/analysis/organizations/gh/codacy/repositories/docs?branch=api-overview' \
     -H 'api-token: <your account API token>'
```

**For `POST`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` requests**, besides the parameters included in the URL you may also need to include a JSON body.

For example, to call the endpoint [searchRepositoryIssues](https://api.codacy.com/api/api-docs#searchrepositoryissues) specifying the issue levels `Error` and `Warning` in the body:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://app.codacy.com/api/v3/analysis/organizations/gh/codacy/repositories/docs/issues/search' \
     -H 'api-token: <your account API token>' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"levels": ["Error", "Warning"]}'
```

## Using pagination

Endpoints that return lists containing a potential large number of results use cursor-based pagination to return the results in small batches:

-   These endpoints return the results together with a `pagination` object that includes a `cursor`.
-   To obtain the next page of results, call the endpoint again using the `cursor` from the previous response as a parameter.
-   If the response doesn't include a `cursor` it means that the endpoint returned the last page of results.
-   Use the parameter `limit` to configure the number of results that the endpoint returns in each page. The maximum `limit` is 1000 and the default is 100.

!!! note
    To make sure that you receive all results when calling an endpoint with pagination, repeat the process above until the response doesn't include the cursor to obtain another page of results.

For example, the following command requests the first 10 repositories in the Codacy GitHub organization:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://app.codacy.com/api/v3/organizations/gh/codacy/repositories?limit=10'
     -H 'api-token: <your account API token>'
```

The response includes the first 10 results, as well as the cursor to obtain the next page of results:

```json
{
  "data": [
    ...
  ],
  "pagination": {
      "cursor": "codacy_2",
      "limit": 10,
      "total": 156
  }
}
```

To obtain the next page of results, it's necessary to include the `cursor` from the previous page as a parameter:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://app.codacy.com/api/v3/organizations/gh/codacy/repositories?limit=10&cursor=codacy_2'
     -H 'api-token: <your account API token>'
```

If you continue requesting more pages the endpoint will eventually return a `pagination` object that doens't include a `cursor`. This means that you've reached the last page of results:

```json
{
  "data": [
    ...
  ],
  "pagination": {
      "limit": 10,
      "total": 156
  }
}
```
