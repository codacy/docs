!!! tip
    We recommend that you use a dedicated service account for integrating Codacy with your repositories. This will avoid disruption of service if the user who originally enabled the integration stops having access to the repository, such as when the user leaves the team or the organization.

    For more information and instructions on how to set up a dedicated service account see [Why did Codacy stop commenting on pull requests?](../../faq/troubleshooting/why-did-codacy-stop-commenting-on-pull-requests.md)
