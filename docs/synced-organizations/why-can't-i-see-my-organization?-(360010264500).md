# Why can't I see my organization?

If you don't see your organization on Codacy, try the following steps:

1.  Make sure you have access to the organization with the account you are logged in
2.  GitHub Apps only: [Install Codacy in your organization](https://github.com/apps/codacy-production/installations/new).
3.  Force a refresh on Codacy by clicking the üîÅbutton found in the organizations' page.
4.  Revoke Codacy's OAuth app on the git provider website.

If these steps don't solve the issue, please get in touch with us.
