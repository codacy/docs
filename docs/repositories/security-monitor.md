## Supported categories

-   **XSS:** XSS enables attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
-   **Input validation:** Input not validated may originate SQL Injection attacks for instance.
-   **File access:** An attacker may use special paths to access files that shouldn't be accessible.
-   **HTTP:** HTTP headers are a common attack vector for malign users.
-   **Cookies:** An HTTP cookie is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer by the browser while the user is browsing.
-   **Unexpected behaviour:** Assigning values to private APIs might lead to unexpected behavior.
-   **Mass assignment:** Mass assignment is a feature of Rails which allows an application to create a record from the values of a hash.
-   **Insecure storage:** Storing sensitive data using these APIs isn't safe.
-   **Insecure modules/libraries:** Consider possible security implications associated with some modules.
-   **Visibility:** Fields shouldn't have public accessibility.
-   **CSRF:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they're currently authenticated.
-   **Android:** Android-specific issues.
-   **Malicious code:** Exposed internal APIs can be accessed or changed by malicious code or by accident from another package.
-   **Cryptography:** Cryptography is a security technique widely used and there are several cryptographic functions, but not all of them are secure.
-   **Command injection:** Command injection is an attack in which the goal is the execution of arbitrary commands on the host operating system.
-   **Firefox OS:** Sensitive APIs of Firefox OS.
-   **Auth:** Authentication is present in almost all web applications nowadays.
-   **DoS:** The Denial of Service (DoS) attack is focused on making a resource (site, application, server) unavailable for the purpose it was designed.
-   **SQL injection:** A SQL injection attack consists of insertion or "injection" of a SQL query via the input data from the client to the application.
-   **Routes:** Badly configured routes can give unintended access to an attacker.
-   **Regex:** Regex can be used in a Denial of Service attack, that exploits the fact that most Regular Expression implementations may reach heavy computation situations that cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size).
-   **SSL:** Simply using SSL isn't enough to ensure the data you're sending is secure. Man in the middle attacks are well known and widely used.
-   **Other:** Other language-specific security issues.

## Category states

Each security category listed on the left-hand side of the dashboard has one of four states:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>State</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="../images/security-monitor-green.png" alt="Green"></td>
      <td><p><strong>Everything is OK for this category</strong></p>
          <p>All the security patterns in this category are enabled, and no security issues have been found.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="../images/security-monitor-yellow.png" alt="Yellow"></td>
      <td><p><strong>There are security patterns in this category that are disabled</strong></p>
          <p>You should enable the patterns in this category so it's verified. To enable all security patterns on the repository, click the button <strong>More</strong> and select <strong>Turn on all security patterns</strong>.</p>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="../images/security-monitor-red.png" alt="Red"></td>
      <td><p><strong>There are security issues identified for this category</strong></p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="../images/security-monitor-yellow.png" alt="Yellow"></td>
      <td><p><strong>Codacy can't determine if all the security patterns in this category are enabled or not</strong></p>
          <p>This happens when you're using configuration files to control which patterns are enabled. Ensure that you manually enable the listed patterns on your configuration files.</p></td>
    </tr>
