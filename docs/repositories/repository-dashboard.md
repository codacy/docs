# Repository Dashboard

The **Repository Dashboard** provides an overview of the repository code quality and items that require your attention.

To access your Repository Dashboard, select a repository from the [Organization Dashboard](../organizations/organization-overview.md) or open a repository on any other page and select **Dashboard** on the left navigation sidebar.

!!! tip
    You can share the URL of the Repository Dashboard for your **public repositories** to allow other people to see your repository code quality metrics, even if they aren't registered on Codacy.

The top of the Repository Dashboard displays:

-   The name and [code quality grade](../faq/code-analysis/which-metrics-does-codacy-calculate.md#grade) of the repository
-   A drop-down list that selects which branch of your repository to display on the dashboard

On the Repository Dashboard you have the following areas to help you monitor your repository:

-   [Quality evolution chart](#quality-evolution-chart)
-   [Issues breakdown](#issues-breakdown)
-   [Coverage](#coverage)
-   [Open pull requests](#open-pull-requests)

The following sections provide a detailed overview of each dashboard area.

## Quality evolution chart

The **Quality evolution** chart displays the evolution of the repository code quality regarding [issues](../faq/code-analysis/which-metrics-does-codacy-calculate.md#issues), [complex files](../faq/code-analysis/which-metrics-does-codacy-calculate.md#complexity), [duplication](../faq/code-analysis/which-metrics-does-codacy-calculate.md#duplication), and [code coverage](../faq/code-analysis/which-metrics-does-codacy-calculate.md#code-coverage). Click on **Last 3 months**, **Last 31 days**, or **Last 7 days** to select the time interval of the historical data to display on the chart.

Each tab displays the following information for the corresponding metric:

-   A green or red indicator depending if the metric is within the acceptable quality level or not
-   The current value
-   The variation of the value introduced by the last commit

!!! note
    The coverage tab only displays a value if Codacy received coverage data for the most recent commit. This is because one commit can <span class="skip-vale">easily</span> change the size or number of files on the repository, or even remove some files that had coverage information.

The chart also displays the **trendline** based on the past behavior and the **quality goal** defined on the repository [quality settings](../repositories-configure/adjusting-quality-settings.md).

## Issues breakdown

The **Issues breakdown** area displays the total number of issues found on the selected branch, as well as the distribution of issues across each code quality issue category.

Click **See all issues** to see the full [list of issues](issues.md) found, or click a category to see the issues in that category.

## Coverage

The **Coverage** area displays the percentage of lines of code on the selected branch that are covered by tests versus the [coverage goal](../repositories-configure/adjusting-quality-settings.md#goals) defined in the quality settings of the repository, as well as the number of files:

-   Without coverage
-   With coverage not up to standards (based on the coverage goal)
-   With coverage up to standards (based on the coverage goal)

Click **See all files** to open the [list of files](files.md) in the repository.

!!! tip
    If you don't have coverage set up for your repository yet, the Coverage area provides you with instructions on [how to add coverage for your repository](../coverage-reporter/index.md).

## Open pull requests

The **Open pull requests** area displays the last updated pull requests and the split between the status of all open pull requests in your repository:

-   **Up to standards:** Pull requests that meet the minimum quality levels
-   **Not up to standards:** Pull requests that failed to meet at least one of the [quality gate rules defined for the repository](../repositories-configure/adjusting-quality-settings.md#gates)
-   **Analyzing:** Pull requests currently being analyzed by Codacy

Click a bar segment to display only pull requests with the corresponding status.

To see the details of pull requests, click a pull request from the list or click **See all pull requests** to open the [list of pull requests](pull-requests.md) in the repository.
