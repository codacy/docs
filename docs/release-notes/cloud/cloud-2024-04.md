## Product enhancements

-   It is now possible to display penetration testing results in the Codacy app. See how to [start pen testing with Codacy](https://go.codacy.com/pen-testing-product). (TAROT-2553)
-   In Enterprise plans where Codacy automatically manages seat usage for your organization, the billing period is now based only on the code analysis activity. Codacy app users who donâ€™t contribute to your private repositories no longer occupy a seat. (PLUTO-867)
-   For GitHub, if you have email privacy enabled on the provider, Codacy doesn't show your private emails and uses another available email address when displaying your personal details on lists, search filters, or activity. (PLUTO-794)
-   Codacy now uses installation access tokens to integrate with your GitHub repositories instead of repositories SSH keys. (PLUTO-764)

## Bug fixes

-   Fixed an issue preventing the Codacy app from showing the repository information for specific edge cases of repositories following a gate policy. (PLUTO-900)
-   Fix permissions inconsistency between UI and API to update quality settings (PLUTO-870)
-   Fixed an issue where analysis was allowed for branch names that matched the reserved git pattern refs/heads/main. (IO-905)
-   Fixed a problem regarding git parsing that affected Diff Coverage in some PRs with many file deletions (ALA-880)
-   Fixes on git diff parsing when processing Pull Requests. This fixes some cases where git diff would not show up (ALA-869)
-   Fixed an issue where users were able to list personal organizations that did not have Codacy installed on GitHub (ALA-820)
-   Fixed an issue where the listPullRequestIssues endpoint was not properly returning pagination information (ALA-808)
