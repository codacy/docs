## Product enhancements

-   The Codacy GitHub App no longer requires **Read and write access to Administration** repository permission. For more information, see the [Discontinuation of SSH keys for GitHub repositories](./cloud-2024-01-15-gh-repository-ssh-keys-discontinuation.md). (PLUTO-803)
-   For GitHub, if you have email privacy enabled on the provider, Codacy doesn't show your private emails and uses another available email address when displaying your personal details on lists, search filters, or activity. (PLUTO-794)

## Bug fixes

-   Fix permissions inconsistency between UI and API to update quality settings (PLUTO-870)
-   Fixed an issue where analysis was allowed for branch names that matched the reserved git pattern refs/heads/main. (IO-905)
-   Fixed a problem regarding git parsing that affected Diff Coverage in some PRs with many file deletions (ALA-880)
-   Fixes on git diff parsing when processing Pull Requests. This fixes some cases where git diff would not show up (ALA-869)
-   Fixed an issue where users were able to list personal organizations that did not have Codacy installed on GitHub (ALA-820)
-   Fixed an issue where the listPullRequestIssues endpoint was not properly returning pagination information (ALA-808)
