# Cloud August 2024

These release notes are for the Codacy Cloud updates during August 2024.

ðŸ“¢ [Visit the Codacy roadmap](https://roadmap.codacy.com) and <span class="skip-vale">let us know</span> your feedback on both new and planned product updates!

## Product enhancements
- Semgrep now supports PL/SQL rules from Checkmarx (TCE-942)
- Radon now calculates the average complexity of each file instead of calculating the highest complexity value of the file, which created some confusion (TCE-1091)
- Show status checks protection rule value everywhere in the UI (ALA-1160)
- We made several improvements on the code patterns page (ALA-1080)
- Now we support multiple coding standards (ALA-1119)
- Allow configuring repo-level Code Patterns while following a Coding Standard (ALA-1120)
- If you access the Issues page, you can see the issues grouped by patterns (ALA-1147)
- Now we support poetry.lock files when doing dependency checks with Trivy (TCE-1005)

## Bug fixes
- We fixed a problem with Sonar C# analysing non .cs files creating false positives (IO-1156)
- We fixed a problem with the repository code patterns page not applying the filters correctly (ALA-1222)
- We fixed a problem with losing the context of the branch when navigating to some pages, so now if you are getting info on a specific branch, you'll see information on the same branch on other pages (ALA-1214)
