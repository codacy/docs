# Cloud Release Notes | November 15, 2019

## Product Enhancements

Synced organizations for GitHub are live!

This feature will allow for easier integration with GitHub and organization management. Here you can find our [documentation on the new features and how to use them](../../organizations/what-are-synced-organizations.md).

As a consequence, the next time you log in to Codacy you will see a window asking for one additional permission on GitHub with this information:

![Authorizing access to organizations](images/Screen_Shot_2019-11-15_at_17.37.07.png)

This will allow us to create an organization hook on GitHub for the new Synced organizations that will notify us whenever changes occur on GitHub.
