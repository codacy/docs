# Cloud August 2022

These release notes are for the Codacy Cloud updates during August 2022.

ðŸ“¢ [Visit the Codacy roadmap](https://roadmap.codacy.com) and <span class="skip-vale">let us know</span> your feedback on both new and planned product updates!

## Product enhancements

-   (See https://codacy.slack.com/archives/C015DHTSJUR/p1661864925648219 to help bootstrap the release note for the two issues.) (PLUTO-36, PLUTO-77)
-   Now, the commit and pull request pages display the coverage variation metric with a precision of two decimal places. (IO-93)
-   Now, the [**Files** page](../../repositories/files.md) and the **Files** tab for [commits](../../repositories/commits.md#files-tab) and [pull requests](../../repositories/pull-requests.md#files-tab) displays the coverage variation metric with a precision of two decimal places. (IO-92)
-   Added the new API endpoint [searchOrganizationRepositoriesWithAnalysis](https://api.codacy.com/api/api-docs#searchorganizationrepositorieswithanalysis) to allow searching for repositories in more advanced use cases. For now, it's possible to search for repositories filtered by a list of names. (PLUTO-45)
-   The [Organization Overview](../../organizations/organization-overview.md) now allows filtering repositories to help you see and focus on the information for the repositories that matter most to your team. (CY-5573)
