# Cloud January 2023

These release notes are for the Codacy Cloud updates during January 2023.

ðŸ“¢ [Visit the Codacy roadmap](https://roadmap.codacy.com) and <span class="skip-vale">let us know</span> your feedback on both new and planned product updates!

## Product enhancements

-   The Codacy Coverage Reporter now supports [automatic commit SHA-1 detection](../../coverage-reporter/troubleshooting-coverage-cli-issues.md#commit-detection) on Argo CD. (TS-140)
-   Extended the visibility of the [coding standards page](../../organizations/using-coding-standards.md) to all users, regardless of their permission level. (IO-359)
-   The pull request detail page now displays the [commits that are missing coverage data](../../coverage-reporter/index.md#validating-coverage) for Codacy to calculate the coverage metrics. This information is also visible in the analysis logs. (IO-152)

    <!--NOTE This Jira key appears on two release note pages because the feature had an update after being released (see https://codacy.atlassian.net/browse/COV-137)-->

-   The documentation now includes an end-to-end example illustrating the usage of an [API endpoint to identify commits without coverage data](../../codacy-api/examples/identifying-commits-without-coverage-data.md) to troubleshoot issues with the calculation of coverage metrics. (DOCS-503)

-   Codacy now supports [reporting a summary of the coverage metrics](../../repositories-configure/integrations/github-integration.md#enabling) directly on your pull requests. For now, this feature is only supported on GitHub Cloud. (COV-2, COV-3)

## Bug fixes

-   Codacy no longer counts ignored files towards the [maximum number of files for calculating complexity](../../faq/code-analysis/does-codacy-place-limits-on-the-code-analysis.md). (TS-93)
-   Fixed an issue that caused all ESLint 8 code patterns to be turned off by default when adding a new repository. (TS-50)
-   Fixed the repository page not opening for Bitbucket users with scope `repository:admin` when the Bitbucket repository has many branch restrictions. (PLUTO-290)
-   The Files page now correctly loads and displays more files when scrolling. (PLUTO-225)
-   Improved the reporting of analysis and coverage status to Git providers when new commits are pushed during an ongoing analysis. (IO-341)
