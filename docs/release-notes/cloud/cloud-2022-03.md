## Product enhancements

-   GitLab project members with the Maintainer role can now perform the following operations on Codacy:

    -   Adding the project
    -   Configuring the project
    -   Changing the following analysis settings: ignoring issues and files, configuring code patterns, configuring file extensions, and managing branches
    
    [See the updated permissions](../../organizations/roles-and-permissions-for-synced-organizations.md) for all GitLab roles. (CY-5876)
-   It's also possible to [set up a quality gate rule](../../repositories-configure/adjusting-quality-settings.md#gates) for diff coverage. ![Quality gate rule for diff coverage](../images/cy-5534.png) (CY-5534)

## Bug fixes

-   Included ESLint 8 as a new supported tool and deprecated ESLint 7.

New repositories will use ESLint 7 by default, but **Codacy won't provide more updates for ESLint 7 and will remove ESLint 7 on April 4, 2023**. (CY-5848)
-   Now the `codacy/codacy-coverage-reporter` docker image is published with a stable tag as well. For example we publish `codacy/codacy-coverage-reporter:13.8.0` as well as `codacy/codacy-coverage-reporter:13` (CY-5837)
-   Prevented the tool from crashing by adding graphql as a gem dependency so it can be referenced by user configuration files (CY-5814)
-   Allow Standalone tools to run in the CLI-action (CY-5812)
-   Support Reporting Coverage in AWS CodeBuild CI  (CY-5787)
-   Fixed an issue that caused inconsistencies on the last updated date when listing GitHub repositories. Now, the last updated date is the [date of the last push to the repositories](../../organizations/organization-overview.md#last-updated-repositories). (CY-5784)
-   Added capabilities for results to be sent to Codacy in batches. The size of these batches can be set through a new parameter.
Added capabilities to run only issues analysis using the codacy-analysis-cli (CY-5727)
-   Fixed an issue with the API endpoint to `getRepositoryPullRequest` where the grades for coverage were not being taken into account when calculating if the Pull Request is up to standards. (CY-5716)
-   dartanalyzer now supports including the packages [lints](https://pub.dev/packages/lints){: target="_blank"} and [flutter_lints](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_lints){: target="_blank"} in the `analysis_option.yaml` configuration file. (CY-5626)
-   The re-analyze button is now hidden on repositories that are running analysis through a build server. (CY-4205)
