# Cloud February 2022

These release notes are for the Codacy Cloud updates during February 2022.

ðŸ“¢ [Visit the Codacy roadmap](https://roadmap.codacy.com) and <span class="skip-vale">let us know</span> your feedback on both new and planned product updates!

## Product enhancements

-   It's now possible to click on the organization overview chart to drill down on the information and understand which repositories require attention to improve the organization's code quality. (Beta) (CY-5580)

-   Now, Codacy calculates the new metric [diff coverage for pull requests](../../repositories/pull-requests.md#pull-request-quality-overview). (CY-5533)

    It's also possible to [set up a quality gate rule](../../repositories-configure/adjusting-quality-settings.md#gates) for diff coverage. (CY-5534)
