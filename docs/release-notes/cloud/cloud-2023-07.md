## Product enhancements

-   You can now [use Security and risk management to monitor Jira security issues](../../organizations/managing-security-and-risk.md#managing-integrations). (PUL-1997)
-   When developers commitÂ from GitHub, now Codacy automatically associates all email addresses linked to their GitHub user with a single Codacy committer. This reduces the number of duplicate seats in an organization when developers donâ€™t log in to Codacy.Â Also, the People page for organizations now includes inline help on how to handle duplicate seats. (PLUTO-653)
-   For increased privacy, Codacy no longer requests access to read or write Git SSH keys from your GitHub account. (PLUTO-624)
-   To ensure that Codacy uses the same quality gates across your repositories, organization admins can now apply [gate policies](../../organizations/using-gate-policies.md) to multiple repositories. **Gate policies** are available under the new organization page **Policies**, where you can now also find your **Coding standards**. (PLUTO-484)

## Bug fixes

-   Fixed a bug causing the TSQLlint tool to fail analyzing the correct files and displaying in the UI and API. (TS-470)
-   Fixed an issue that caused Codacy issue permalinks to change between commits. (PUL-2202)
-   Fixed an issue that prevented Codacy from retrieving coverage information for individual files. (ALA-514)
