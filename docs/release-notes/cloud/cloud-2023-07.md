# Cloud July 2023

These release notes are for the Codacy Cloud updates during July 2023.

ðŸ“¢ [Visit the Codacy roadmap](https://roadmap.codacy.com) and <span class="skip-vale">let us know</span> your feedback on both new and planned product updates!

## Product enhancements

-   Added support for AI-generated context-aware comments and fix suggestions directly in your Git provider. For more details, [see the announcement on our blog](https://blog.codacy.com/codacy-quality-ai-actionable-fixes/). (CY-6855, HRZ-286)

    ![AI-generated context-aware comments and fix suggestions](../images/cy-6855.png)

-   You can now use [Security and risk management](../../organizations/managing-security-and-risk.md) to detect security vulnerabilities across your Codacy repositories and Jira issues and assign the Security Manager role to any organization member. For more details, [see the announcement on our blog](https://blog.codacy.com/centralized-view-of-security-issues/). (HRZ-6, PUL-1924, HRZ-180)

-   To ensure that Codacy uses the same quality gates across your repositories, organization admins can now apply [gate policies](../../organizations/using-gate-policies.md) to multiple repositories. **Gate policies** are available under the new organization page **Policies**, where you can now also find your **Coding standards**. (PLUTO-484)

-   For increased privacy, Codacy no longer requests access to read or write Git SSH keys from your GitHub account. (PLUTO-624)

-   When developers commit from GitHub, now Codacy automatically associates all email addresses linked to their GitHub user with a single Codacy committer. This reduces the number of duplicate seats in an organization when developers donâ€™t log in to Codacy. (PLUTO-653)

## Bug fixes

-   Fixed a bug causing the TSQLLint tool to fail analyzing the correct files and displaying in the UI and API. (TS-470)
-   Fixed an issue that caused Codacy issue permalinks to change between commits. (PUL-2202)
-   Fixed an issue that prevented Codacy from retrieving coverage information for individual files. (ALA-514)
