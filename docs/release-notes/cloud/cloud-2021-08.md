# Cloud August 2021

These release notes are for the Codacy Cloud updates during August 2021.

ðŸ“¢ [Visit the Codacy roadmap](https://roadmap.codacy.com) and <span class="skip-vale">let us know</span> your feedback on both new and planned product updates!

## Product enhancements

It's now possible to [configure the Codacy quality settings](../../repositories-configure/adjusting-quality-settings.md) with the minimum severity level of new issues and a maximum number of new security issues, giving you more control over the pull requests that Codacy blocks from being merged. Besides this, the status reported by Codacy on pull requests now includes more information on why the quality checks failed. (CY-4216)
