**Bug fixes**

-   <span style="font-weight: 400;">Fixed a bug that was preventing
    accounts from being reactivated</span>
-   <span style="font-weight: 400;">Fixed a bug where we couldn’t import
    any projects from a Bitbucket organization if there were problems
    with one team </span>
-   <span style="font-weight: 400;">Fixed a bug that forced the user to
    login with Bitbucket to be able to see the Bitbucket projects. Now
    the user can log in with Bitbucket or GitHub and still be able to
    add projects from the other provider.  </span>
