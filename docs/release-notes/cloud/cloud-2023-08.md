# Cloud August 2023

These release notes are for the Codacy Cloud updates during August 2023.

ðŸ“¢ [Visit the Codacy roadmap](https://roadmap.codacy.com) and <span class="skip-vale">let us know</span> your feedback on both new and planned product updates!

## Product enhancements

-   The CSV file exported by Security and risk management now includes three new columns: file path, line number, and detected pattern. (TAROT-2203)
-   When developers commit from GitHub, now Codacy automatically associates all email addresses linked to their GitHub user with a single Codacy committer. This reduces the number of duplicate seats in an organization when developers donâ€™t log in to Codacy. Also, the People page for organizations now includes inline help on how to handle duplicate seats. (PLUTO-653)
-   When developers commit from Bitbucket, now Codacy automatically associates all commit email addresses belonging to the same Bitbucket user with a single Codacy committer. This reduces the number of duplicate seats for Bitbucket organizations when developers donâ€™t log in to Codacy. (PLUTO-652)
-   The [getRepositoryWithAnalysis API endpoint](https://api.codacy.com/api/api-docs#getrepositorywithanalysis) now includes data about coverable and covered lines for a given repository. (ALA-254)

## Bug fixes

-   Pylint now supports Python 3.11 syntax. (TS-467)
-   The bug was on the Permissions where a user to cancel its own join request was required to be either <span class="skip-vale">User.Admin or Org.Admin</span> (PLUTO-692)
-   Fixed an issue that caused the People page to show fewer emails than expected for committers who are also members. (PLUTO-691)
-   Fixed an issue that prevented unauthenticated users from accessing the coverage dashboard of a public repository. (ALA-524)
