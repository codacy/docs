# Scheduled Maintenance Saturday, 17th Nov@8:00 GMT (0:00 PST)

Codacy will be unavailable forÂ approximately 1 hour this Saturday, 17th of Nov. at [8:00 AM GMT](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=3&iso=20181117T08&p1=%3A&ah=1) (0:00 PST) while we perform some necessary updates that will allow us to scale storage and improve the capacity and performance of our analysis.

During this maintenance window, Codacy platform and API will be inaccessible and analysis will be paused. Any commit hooks received during the maintenance will be ignored. All operations around the platform, including analysis of commits and PRs will resume immediately after the maintenance window.

We appreciate your patience and apologize in advance for any inconvenience this may cause. As always, if you have questions or issues, please reach out to us.
