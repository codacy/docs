# Removal of PMD (Legacy) February 16, 2022

On the week of February 16th 2022, we'll be removing a tool from Codacy.

The tool is PMD (Legacy).

This tool is an old version of PMD which was introduced to allow a smoother migration to PMD 6.

Since PMD 6 is now very stable and is better than PMD 5 in every aspect we're removing it from the platform.

## If you were using PMD (Legacy)

If you want to continue to use PMD, we suggest to enable the PMD tool.
Check our [Configuring Code Patterns](../../repositories-configure/configuring-code-patterns.md) page to know how to enable PMD.
