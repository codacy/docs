# Removal of PMD (Legacy) February 16, 2022

On the week of February 16th 2022 we'll be removing the tool **PMD (Legacy)** from Codacy.

The **PMD (Legacy)** tool runs [PMD 5.8.1](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/releases/tag/pmd_releases%2F5.8.1){: target="_blank"}, and was introduced to allow a smoother migration to PMD 6.

However, the legacy version of PMD is almost five years old and is no longer being maintained by the tool developers, while PMD 6 is now very stable and provides newer features.

## If you were using PMD (Legacy)

To continue using PMD to analyze your repositories, [enable the **PMD** tool](../../repositories-configure/configuring-code-patterns.md) on the **Code patterns** page of your repositories.

If you have any questions or need help, please contact <mailto:support@codacy.com>.
