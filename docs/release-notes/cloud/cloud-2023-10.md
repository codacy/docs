# Cloud October 2023

These release notes are for the Codacy Cloud updates during October 2023.

ðŸ“¢ [Visit the Codacy roadmap](https://roadmap.codacy.com) and <span class="skip-vale">let us know</span> your feedback on both new and planned product updates!

## Product enhancements

-   You can now get two additional coverage status reports on GitHub using the new faster Coverage engine, showing whether your diff coverage and coverage variation are up to standards or not as configured on the quality gate rules for your repository. See [how to activate this setting](../../repositories-configure/integrations/github-integration.md#new-coverage-engine) for a repository. (ALA-593)

    !!! note
        This setting has been active by default since Dec. 1st, 2023. See [how to update your setup to use the new Coverage status reports](./cloud-2023-12-01-new-coverage-engine-status-reports.md).

-   The permission level set for the **Analysis configuration** on the organization **Settings > Member privileges** now applies also to the reanalysis of a pull request or the last commit in a branch. (PLUTO-587)

## Bug fixes

-   Fixed an issue that caused code duplication warnings to link to the original code block instead of the duplicated one. (TS-545)
-   TSQLLint can now also detect and analyze files with an `sql` extension. (TS-543)
-   Codacy no longer supports and now skips the analysis of branches named `HEAD` or matching the pattern `refs/heads/*`, as these are Git reserved terms. (IO-830)

## Tool deprecations

-   On October 13th 2023 we deprecated the tool **bundler-audit**. For more information, [see the deprecation notice](./cloud-2023-10-13-bundler-audit-deprecation.md).
