# Cloud May 2024

These release notes are for the Codacy Cloud updates during May 2024.

ðŸ“¢ [Visit the Codacy roadmap](https://roadmap.codacy.com) and <span class="skip-vale">let us know</span> your feedback on both new and planned product updates!

## Product enhancements

-   You can now [create a new coding standard](../../organizations/using-coding-standards.md#creating) by adjusting the sensitivity of preset category groups. This option is also available when setting up a new organization to create a default coding standard. (ALA-824)

-   Improved repositories integration with the Git provider:

    -   Now the integration is always enabled. For [GitLab](../../repositories-configure/integrations/gitlab-integration.md#refreshing) and [Bitbucket](../../repositories-configure/integrations/bitbucket-integration.md#refreshing), repository admins are able to refresh the integration in case the user who added the repository to Codacy loses access to the repository.
    -   For consistency across the Codacy app, we renamed the [GitLab](../../repositories-configure/integrations/gitlab-integration.md#configuring) and [Bitbucket](../../repositories-configure/integrations/bitbucket-integration.md#configuring) integration options - **Pull Request Status** is now **Status checks**, **Pull Request Comment** is now **Issue annotations**, and **Pull Request Summary** is now **Issue summaries**. (CY-6612)

-   Organization admins now see on the **Repositories list** the total number of repositories that have already been added to the organization. (CY-7305)

-   Added duplication analysis support for Dart via [jscpd](https://github.com/kucherenko/jscpd). (TCE-983)
-   Added support for an alternative RuboCop configuration file for Codacy analysis, `.rubocop-codacy.yml`. (TCE-983)
-   Added dependency vulnerability scanning support for Java via [Trivy](https://trivy.dev/). (TCE-794)

## Bug fixes

-   Fixed an issue that caused [Security and risk management](../../organizations/managing-security-and-risk.md) to miscalculate the counts of open findings in aggregated data. (TAROT-2682)
-   Fixed an issue preventing the analysis of a file that had previously been [ignored using the Codacy configuration file](../../repositories-configure/codacy-configuration-file.md#ignore-files) and later removed from `exclude_path` setting. (TCE-924)
