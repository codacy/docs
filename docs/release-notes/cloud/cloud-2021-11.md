# Cloud November 2021

These release notes are for the Codacy Cloud updates during November 2021.

ðŸ“¢ [Visit the Codacy roadmap](https://roadmap.codacy.com) and <span class="skip-vale">let us know</span> your feedback on both new and planned product updates!

## Product enhancements

-   Now, Codacy supports linting OpenAPI and AsyncAPI descriptions in either YAML or JSON files using [Spectral](https://stoplight.io/open-source/spectral/). (CY-5088)

-   You can now [use an organization coding standard](../../organizations/using-coding-standards.md) to apply the same coding best practices, conventions, or security rules to a group of repositories. (CY-4654)

-   The Codacy API now includes [a set of endpoints](https://api.codacy.com/api/api-docs#codacy-api-coding-standards) for creating, managing, and applying organization coding standards programmatically. (CY-4617)

## Bug fixes

-   The Files page now allows sorting the list by each column. (CY-5255)
-   Fixed an issue that prevented the message "Refresh the page to see the results" from being displayed on the commit and pull request pages after an analysis was completed. (CY-5187)
-   Fixed some default regular expressions on [<span class="skip-vale">codacy-checkstyle</span>](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-checkstyle) that could cause the code pattern PackageName to report false positives when configured using the Codacy UI. (CY-5185)
-   Fixed an issue that caused ESLint to report false positive issues regarding import statement organization if prettier was enabled. (CY-5143)
-   Fixed the issue cards in the context of a file to display the issue category. (CY-5125)
