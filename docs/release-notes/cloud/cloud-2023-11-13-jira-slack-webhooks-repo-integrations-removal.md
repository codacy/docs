# Removal of Jira, Slack, and Webhooks repository integrations November 13, 2023

On the week of November 13th 2023 we removed the option to create, configure, and delete **Jira**, **Slack**, and **Webhooks integrations for your repositories**. These integrations were available on the repository **Settings**, tab **Integration**.

Existing integrations will keep working for now, we'll remove them on a second phase. However, you're no longer able to configure or delete them on the Codacy app.

Due to very low usage of these integrations, their maintenance had been neglected for years. Thus, they were starting to negatively impact our speed to deliver new features. Although there's no timeline in place to make these integrations available again, we're open to looking into them upon feedback.

## Removal of existing integrations

<!--TODO CY-7215 Update date-->On the week of MM DD YYYY we'll be removing Jira, Slack, and Webhooks repository integrations from the Codacy app. Your existing integrations will stop working and we'll delete all related data, including authentication data.

## If you are using Jira, Slack, or Webhooks repository integrations

If you have critical workflows relying on these integrations, please contact us at <mailto:support@codacy.com> so we can advise on the best alternative.
