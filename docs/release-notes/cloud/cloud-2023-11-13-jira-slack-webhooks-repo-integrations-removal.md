# Removal of Jira, Slack, and Webhooks integrations on repository level November 13, 2023

On the week of November 13th 2023 we removed the option to create, configure, and delete Jira, Slack, and Webhooks integrations for your repositories. These integrations were available on the repository **Settings**, tab **Integration**.

<!--TODO CY-7215 Add rationale for this removal-->

## Removal of existing integrations

On the week of MM DDth YYYY we'll be removing your existing integrations.

<!--TODO CY-7215 Impacts?-->

## If you are using Jira, Slack, or Webhooks repository integration

Your existing integrations will keep working until MM DDth YYYY, but you are no longer able to configure, or delete them on the Codacy app.

<!--TODO CY-7215 Instructions for customers?-->

If you have any questions or need help, please contact <mailto:support@codacy.com>.
