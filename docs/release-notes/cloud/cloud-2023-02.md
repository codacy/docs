## Bug fixes

-   Fixed an issue that prevented organization owners from receiving the email notification with new requests to join the Codacy organization when the requester user didn't have a name set up. (PLUTO-365)
-   Fixed an unexpected error when editing a coding standard and moving back to the **Select languages** step and then forward to the tool selection step. (IO-434)
-   Fixed an issue that caused Codacy to send incorrect analysis status notifications to Git providers when failing to reanalyze a pull request. (IO-424)
-   The **Files** page on public repositories now correctly displays the **Coverage** column to users who are logged out. (COV-181)
-   Fixed the scenarios where Codacy didn't merge the coverage data from [multiple coverage reports](../../coverage-reporter/uploading-coverage-in-advanced-scenarios.md#multiple-reports). (COV-147)
