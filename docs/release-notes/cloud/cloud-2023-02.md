## Product enhancements

-   In some Enterprise plans, Codacy now automatically adds to the organization new people that commit to your private repositories and analyzes their commits, providing a more streamlined user management experience. (PLUTO-244)

## Bug fixes

-   Fixed an issue that prevented organization owners from receiving the email notification with new requests to join the Codacy organization when the requester user didn't have a name set up. (PLUTO-365)
-   Fixed an unexpected error when editing a coding standard and moving back to the **Select languages** step and then forward to the tool selection step. (IO-434)
