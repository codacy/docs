# Semgrep to Opengrep migration – February 2026

As we previously discussed on our [blog](https://blog.codacy.com/opengrep-vs-semgrep), there have been licensing changes to Semgrep, and Opengrep has emerged as an open-source fork of the Semgrep engine. To ensure your continued access to the existing patterns we have switched to Opengrep.

This change has been performed as a 1:1 replacement, preserving all existing patterns, issue history, and configuration. Going forward, we'll also be able to keep delivering custom Codacy rules to protect you against emerging threats, such as [hidden Unicode character vulnerabilities in rules files](https://blog.codacy.com/vulnerability-in-rules-files-with-hidden-unicode-characters).
