## Product enhancements

-   The **Status** column of the [coverage reports list](../../coverage-reporter.md#validating-coverage) now includes direct links to troubleshooting instructions when there are coverage errors. (IO-155)
-   Improved the performance of applying [coding standards](../../organizations/using-a-coding-standard.md) to repositories to avoid timeouts when updating hundreds of repositories. (PLUTO-83)
-   Codacy now supports the [client-side tool Unity Roslyn Analyzers](../../related-tools/local-analysis/client-side-tools.md) for reporting error-prone and performance issues on C# projects that use the Unity framework. (IO-96)

## Bug fixes

-   Bumping codacy-pmd to use the pmd version 6.51.0 (CY-6630)
-   Fixed an issue that caused Codacy to calculate coverage taking into account the total lines of code instead of the coverable lines of code. This scenario happened if Codacy received the coverage reports before completing the static code analysis for the corresponding commit. (IO-250)
-   Codacy now sends the ref (branch name) when communicating with Gitlab for Analysis statuses. (CY-6607)
-   Fix a situation where the coverage would be calculated at the end of an analysis if the final coverage report was not received. (IO-236)
-   Now, Codacy asks for confirmation when you change a code pattern parameter on a repository that follows a coding standard. (PLUTO-149)
-   Fixed a bug that was keeping Intercom logged in after logging out from Codacy. (CY-6605)
-   Rubocop is using version 1.38.0 (CY-6600)
-   Bumping codacy-markdownlint to use v0.26.2 (CY-6586)
-   Codacy-remark-lint uses now the plugin remark-gfm (CY-6513)
-   Now, Codacy correctly posts the coverage status check on the Git provider even if the coverage report uploaded to Codacy only contains data for ignored files. (IO-149)
