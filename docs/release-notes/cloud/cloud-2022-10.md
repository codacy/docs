# Cloud October 2022

These release notes are for the Codacy Cloud updates during October 2022.

ðŸ“¢ [Visit the Codacy roadmap](https://roadmap.codacy.com) and <span class="skip-vale">let us know</span> your feedback on both new and planned product updates!

## Product enhancements

-   Improved the performance and error handling of retrieving many open pull requests from the Git providers while populating the [**Pull requests** page](../../repositories/pull-requests.md). (IO-133)
-   While [configuring a coding standard](../../organizations/using-coding-standards.md), you can now click the linkÂ **Enable/Disable all &lt;N&gt; patterns** to toggle all patterns matching the current filters, including the code patterns that weren't loaded on the list yet. (CY-6255)

## Bug fixes

-   Now, Codacy correctly posts the coverage status check on the Git provider even if the coverage report uploaded to Codacy only contains data for ignored files. (IO-149)
-   Added support for the following ESLint plugins:
    -   [<span class="skip-vale">prettier-plugin-tailwindcss</span>](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss) (CY-6570)
    -   [<span class="skip-vale">eslint-plugin-typescript-sort-keys</span>](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-typescript-sort-keys) (CY-6561)
-   Fixed an issue that could cause Codacy to fail the quality gate **Coverage variation is under** if the coverage variation was equal to the defined threshold. (CY-6558)
-   Now, the coverage report parser also takes into account lines of type `cond` in Clover coverage reports. (CY-6384)
