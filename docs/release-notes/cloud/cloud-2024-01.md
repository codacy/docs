# Cloud January 2024

These release notes are for the Codacy Cloud updates during January 2024.

ðŸ“¢ [Visit the Codacy roadmap](https://roadmap.codacy.com) and <span class="skip-vale">let us know</span> your feedback on both new and planned product updates!

## Product enhancements

-   Codacy now uses installation access tokens to integrate with your GitHub repositories instead of repositories SSH keys, which are being discontinued. For more information, [see the discontinuation notice](./cloud-2024-01-15-gh-repository-ssh-keys-discontinuation.md) (PLUTO-764)
-   You can now filter the [security and risk items](../../organizations/managing-security-and-risk.md) by security category. (TAROT-2444)

## Bug fixes

-   Fixed an error for GitHub organizations preventing the repositories list from loading on the **Manage repositories** modal when retrieving a large number of repositories. (PLUTO-854)
-   The pull requests list now shows partial results when one of the pull request has errors. (PLUTO-838)
-   Fixed an error causing pull requests to have missing source commits, preventing them from being correctly displayed on the Codacy UI. (IO-915)
-   Fixed an issue that caused some security and risk management items to display the wrong severity. (TAROT-2517)

## Feature removal

-   We deleted the existing Slack, Jira, and WebhookÂ repository integrations, and all related data, including authentication data. For more information, [see the deprecation notice](./cloud-2023-11-13-jira-slack-webhooks-repo-integrations-removal.md). (CY-7202, CY-7203, CY-7204)
-   The repository security monitor has been replaced by the [Security and risk management feature](../../organizations/managing-security-and-risk.md), which shows the information related to the repositories that each member follows. (TAROT-2444)
