# Cloud June 2024

These release notes are for the Codacy Cloud updates during June 2024.

ðŸ“¢ [Visit the Codacy roadmap](https://roadmap.codacy.com) and <span class="skip-vale">let us know</span> your feedback on both new and planned product updates!

## Product enhancements

-   You can now [filter Security and Risk Management findings by scan type](../../organizations/managing-security-and-risk.md#scan-types) to see results based on the detection method, including Code Scanning, Software Composition Analysis, Exposed Secrets, Infrastructure as Code, and Penetration Testing. (TCE-1028)
-   For increased security, Codacy now sets [automatic expiration timeouts](../../account/user-session-management.md) for every session. (PLUTO-879)
-   The Codacy configuration file now supports a [new field `include_paths`](../../repositories-configure/codacy-configuration-file.md#include-files) that lets you explicitly specify files or directories to include in the analysis. This is particularly useful for bypassing files or directories that are ignored by default or specified in `exclude_paths`. (TCE-977)
-   Codacy can now detect duplicated code in the following languages: CoffeeScript, Elixir, Groovy, Objective C, Rust, Visual Basic (TCE-1021)

## Bug fixes

-   Fixed an issue that caused missing data in the user interface when navigating the Gate policies settings in the Codacy app. (PLUTO-918)
-   Fixed an issue that caused discrepancies in reported coverage variation values. (TCE-948)
-   Fixed a case-sensitivity issue when analyzing file paths in coverage reports. (TCE-982)

## Deprecations

-   On June 5th, Codacy [stopped sending status checks from the old Coverage engine](./cloud-2023-11-23-new-coverage-engine-status-checks.md#deprecation-and-removal-calendar-for-the-old-coverage-engine-status-checks). (ALA-767)
