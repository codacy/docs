## Product enhancements


## Bug fixes

-   Fixed an issue that would allow requests to be triggered from our servers by injecting a URL into the cursor parameter of the API endpoint to list organization repositories. (CY-5139)
-   Added protection against CSRF attacks targeting the Codacy API v3. In the case of phishing, even if the victim opens a malicious link, the attack won't work. CVSS v3.1 score: 6.4 (Medium) (CY-5131)
-   Fixed an issue that caused secondary emails from GitLab not show in Codacy. (CY-5130)
-   Fixed an issue that was causing organisations using the legacy startup plan to get wrong messages about missing members and to not be able to reanalyse commits and PRs  (CY-5112)
-   Fix an issue on Cloud that made some features that depended on the payment plan miss-behave on rare cases. Like GitHub suggestions not being available after start paying for an organization (CY-5107)
-   Added support for the Javascript extension `.mjs`. (CY-5086)
-   Added @next/eslint-plugin-next to ESLint when using configuration file (CY-5071)
-   Fixed an issue that caused "Pro" subscriptions that were cancelled ahead of time to become invalid immediately instead of on the scheduled date for cancellation.  (CY-5025)
-   Name is not a required identifier for an account. The UI was assuming this was necessary and validating the input wrongly. We removed any validation in our UI to go accordingly with provider's options. (CY-779)
