# Cloud December 2022

These release notes are for the Codacy Cloud updates during December 2022.

ðŸ“¢ [Visit the Codacy roadmap](https://roadmap.codacy.com) and <span class="skip-vale">let us know</span> your feedback on both new and planned product updates!

## Product enhancements

-   The pull request detail page now displays a message when Codacy can't calculate the pull request metrics. The message includes a link to the **Coverage** tab in your repository settings, where you can [test and validate your coverage setup](../../coverage-reporter/index.md#validating-coverage). (IO-152)

## Bug fixes

-   Fixed an issue that caused Codacy to display the coverage value on the wrong file in specific edge cases. (COV-25)
-   All [coding standards API endpoints](https://api.codacy.com/api/api-docs#codacy-api-coding-standards) now return the **`403 Forbidden`** status code when authorization is required instead of **`401 Forbidden`**, since user permissions on Codacy are [synced with the permissions on the Git provider](../../organizations/roles-and-permissions-for-organizations.md) and re-authenticating the user doesn't change the access to the endpoints. (IO-333)

-   Fixed an issue affecting GitLab repositories configured to use merge request pipelines, where Codacy would create a separate branch pipeline. (PLUTO-184)
-   Fixed an issue that caused Checkov to output warnings when the tool had no files to analyze. (TS-11)
