# Cloud March 2024

These release notes are for the Codacy Cloud updates during March 2024.

📢 [Visit the Codacy roadmap](https://roadmap.codacy.com) and <span class="skip-vale">let us know</span> your feedback on both new and planned product updates!

## Product enhancements

-   Streamlined new organization setup with a guided path for adding new organizations and a setup checklist on the [Organization overview](../../organizations/reporting/organization-overview.md) page. (ALA-825)
-   It's now possible to display penetration testing results in the Codacy app. See how to [start pen testing with Codacy](https://go.codacy.com/pen-testing-product). (TAROT-2553)
-   It's now possible to [unfollow a repository](../../organizations/managing-repositories.md#follow-unfollow) through the Codacy app. (PLUTO-902)
-   In Enterprise plans where Codacy automatically manages seat usage for your organization, the billing period is now based only on the code analysis activity. Codacy app users who don’t contribute to your private repositories no longer occupy a seat. (PLUTO-867)

## Bug fixes

-   Fixed a bug that prevented Security and risk management items from linking to their respective Jira issues. (TAROT-2648)
-   Fixed an issue preventing pull requests from showing on Codacy due to Git operations timeout when synchronizing the current state of a repository. (IO-1019)
-   Fixed an issue that caused sidebar labels to overlap interactive interface elements on smaller screens. (CY-7193)
-   Fixed a bug that prevented Codacy from calculating diff coverage correctly when the diff contained only removed files. (ALA-921)

## Feature removal

-   We removed the option to bulk copy code patterns between repositories and to import code pattern configurations from another repository. If you want to share tool and code pattern configurations between repositories, the recommended approach is to use a [coding standard](../../organizations/using-coding-standards.md). (ALA-826)
