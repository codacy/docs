## Product enhancements

-   Now, Codacy [displays diff coverage as not applicable](../../repositories/pull-requests.md#pull-request-quality-overview) (represented by `âˆ…`) when there are no coverable lines included in a pull request. (CY-5960)

## Bug fixes

-   Fixed an issue that caused commits to be in the "Analyzing" state indefinitely if the setting **Run the repository analysis on your build server** was off and a client-side result was uploaded to the repository. (CY-6136)
-   Improved the coverage data processing reliability and speed on repositories with a high workload. (CY-6135)
-   Increased the timeout limit when uploading coverage data to Codacy using the Codacy Coverage Reporter. (CY-6092)
-   Improved the error message displayed by the Codacy Coverage Reporter in case of a timeout while uploading coverage data to Codacy. (CY-6072)
-   Fixed an issue that caused analyzing C# repositories to fail because of an outdated Sonar C# tool. (CY-6061)
-   Fixed an issue that could be used by an attacker to redirect Codacy users to a malicious URL. CVSS v3.1 score: 6.5 (Medium) (CY-6052)
-   Fixed an issue that prevented the complexity metric from being calculated for C# repositories. Now, the complexity value is visible for all C# repositories, both on the Repository Dashboard and on the Files page. (CY-6006)
