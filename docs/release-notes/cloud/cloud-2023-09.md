## Product enhancements

-   You can now use the new Codacy Visual Studio Code extension to get the full list of problems found by Codacy for a pull request and navigate to any Quality issue that you want to review and fix. See [how to install and use the Codacy Visual Studio Code extension](../../getting-started/integrating-codacy-with-visual-studio-code.md). (ALA-549)
-   It is now possible to send notifications to a Slack channel of your choice whenever Codacy detects new critical Security issues in the default branch of any repository in your organization. See [how to install the Codacy Slack integration for Security issues](../../organizations/integrations/slack-integration.md). (TAROT-2242)
-   Now, when you switch to a different Enterprise plan or cancel your plan, Codacy no longer re-triggers your repositories analysis automatically. To ensure all information is updated on Codacy UI after changing or canceling your plan, re-analyze your repositories or push new commits. (PLUTO-667)
-   In some Enterprise plans, Codacy now automatically manages people activity and seat usage for your organization. (PLUTO-647)
-   In some Enterprise plans, you can now navigate from the Last Analysis column on the People page list to the details of the last analyzed pull request or commit. The link is only available for analysis executed from 11 Sep 2023. (PLUTO-644)

## Bug fixes

-   Fixed an incorrect popup being shown when loading the repository Code patterns page. (PLUTO-717)
-   Fixed an issue where providers that do not send events for change of main branch (bitbucket, gitlab) would get an empty dashboard page and failures to analyse PRs that targeted the main branch. (IO-799)
