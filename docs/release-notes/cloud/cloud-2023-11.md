# Cloud November 2023

These release notes are for the Codacy Cloud updates during November 2023.

ðŸ“¢ [Visit the Codacy roadmap](https://roadmap.codacy.com) and <span class="skip-vale">let us know</span> your feedback on both new and planned product updates!

## Product enhancements

-   Added [support for Semgrepâ€™s open-source engine](../../getting-started/supported-languages-and-tools.md) to perform static application security testing (SAST), with the option to upgrade to Semgrep Pro. (TAROT-2347)
-   You now get two additional coverage status reports from the new, faster Coverage engine on your Git provider, showing whether your diff coverage and coverage variation are up to standard or not as configured on the quality gate rules for your repository. (ALA-624)

    !!! note
        This setting is active by default. [If you're using GitHub, see how to update your setup to use the new Coverage status reports](./cloud-2023-11-23-new-coverage-engine-status-checks.md).

## Bug fixes

-   The Codacy Coverage engine can now process coverage reports that contain an arbitrarily large number of hits for each covered line. (ALA-660)

## Deprecations

-   Dropped support for repository-level Slack, Jira, and Webhook integrations. For more information, [see the deprecation notice](./cloud-2023-11-13-jira-slack-webhooks-repo-integrations-removal.md). (CY-7202, CY-7203, CY-7204)
