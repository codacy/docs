# Cloud January 2022

These release notes are for the Codacy Cloud updates during January 2022.

ðŸ“¢ [Visit the Codacy roadmap](https://roadmap.codacy.com) and <span class="skip-vale">let us know</span> your feedback on both new and planned product updates!

## Product enhancements

-   The Codacy API now includes endpoints that allow you to [create and manage project API tokens programmatically](../../codacy-api/examples/creating-project-api-tokens-programmatically.md). This feature can be used to automate setting up coverage for either new repositories or for all your existing repositories. (CY-5090)
-   Added the plugin [<span class="skip-vale">eslint-plugin-storybook</span>](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-storybook) to [<span class="skip-vale">codacy-eslint</span>](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-eslint). (CY-5406)
-   Now, Codacy supports static code analysis for Dart/Flutter projects using [dartanalyzer](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/tree/main/pkg/analyzer_cli){: target="_blank"}. The new tool checks your code for errors and warnings that are specified in the [Dart language specification](https://dart.dev/guides/language/spec){: target="_blank"}. (CY-4314)

## Bug fixes

-   Updated the Git URL used to clone public repositories to comply with the recent [GitHub protocol changes](https://github.blog/2021-09-01-improving-git-protocol-security-github/){: target="_blank"}. (CY-5436)
-   Fixed an issue that could prevent users from using the Codacy app website temporarily if they were exposed to a phishing <span class="skip-vale">attack</span>. CVSS v3.1 score: 3.1 (Low) (CY-5420)
-   Fixed a security issue that, under rare circumstances, could allow an attacker to run arbitrary code on the **Ignored files** settings page. CVSS v3.1 score: 3.8 (Low) (CY-5419)
