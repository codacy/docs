# Cloud April 2023

These release notes are for the Codacy Cloud updates during April 2023.

ðŸ“¢ [Visit the Codacy roadmap](https://roadmap.codacy.com) and <span class="skip-vale">let us know</span> your feedback on both new and planned product updates!

## Product enhancements

-   Weâ€™ve revamped the way you [manage your repositories](../../organizations/managing-repositories.md) on Codacy. You can now select which repositories you want to follow on Codacy, giving you more control over your dashboard for a cleaner, more personalized view. (PLUTO-336)

## Bug fixes

-   It's now possible to see and change the repository settings for repositories without commits or before Codacy finishes performing the first analysis. (TS-320)
-   The button to reanalyze commits or pull requests is now disabled if the committer isn't part of the organization. (PLUTO-49)
-   Improved the performance of the Code patterns page while listing many code patterns. (IO-479)
-   Now, the link "See all files" on the **Coverage** area of the Repository Dashboard navigates to the Files page on the currently selected branch. (CY-6823)
-   Fixed an issue that could cause Codacy to report the diff coverage metric as `âˆ…` (not applicable) even though there weren't any uploaded coverage reports. (COV-152)
