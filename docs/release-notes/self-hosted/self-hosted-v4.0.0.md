# Self-hosted v4.0.0

These release notes are for [Codacy Self-hosted v4.0.0](https://github.com/codacy/chart/releases/tag/4.0.0){: target="_blank"}, released on May 18, 2021.

To upgrade Codacy, follow [these instructions](../../chart/maintenance/upgrade.md).

## Breaking changes

This version of Codacy Self-hosted requires [PostgreSQL version 10.15](https://docs.codacy.com/v4.0/chart/requirements/#postgresql-server-setup) since the previous major version [will reach end-of-life (EOL) later this year](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/).

To upgrade PostgreSQL:

1.  Follow the instructions on [how to upgrade a PostgreSQL cluster](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/upgrading.html).

1.  After the upgrade, clean the Codacy databases with [vacuumdb](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/app-vacuumdb.html) to prevent the <span class="skip-vale">autovacuum</a> feature from momentarily affecting the performance of the databases at a later time.

## Product enhancements

-   Improved the loading time of the [repositories list](https://docs.codacy.com/v4.0/organizations/managing-repositories/) page when an organization has many repositories. (CY-4084)
-   Now, Codacy allows [configuring who is allowed to manage file extensions and branches](https://docs.codacy.com/v4.0/organizations/roles-and-permissions-for-synced-organizations/#change-analysis-configuration). (CY-3886, CY-3887)

## Bug fixes

-   Fixed wrong feedback message that mentioned disabling tools when toggling between the UI settings and configuration file for a tool on the Code patterns page. (CY-4276)
-   Fixed an issue where Codacy could fail to show repositories for organizations with more than 1000 repositories on GitHub. (CY-4193)
-   Fixed an issue that prevented users from ignoring issues even if they had the correct permissions. (CY-4161)
-   Now, you can use `.eslintrc.cjs` files to configure ESLint in your project. (CY-4146)
-   Fixed an issue that caused some cookies to be transmitted in plaintext when accessing `app.codacy.com` via HTTP with Firefox. (CY-4143)
-   Fixed an issue where repositories added to Codacy would have the GitHub status turned off. Now it's turned on by default for newly added repositories. (CY-4110)
-   Now, Codacy automatically ignores `*.Designer.cs` files from the analysis. (CY-4102)
