## Breaking changes

ESLint 8 will be **enabled by default on new repositories** starting on this version of Codacy Self-hosted.

The previous Codacy Self-hosted version [already included ESLint 8 as a new supported tool and deprecated ESLint 7](self-hosted-v7.0.0.md#product-enhancements), and Codacy recommends that you migrate to the new version of the tool to benefit from the new features and fixes of ESLint.

See [how to migrate your configuration files to use ESLint 8](../cloud/cloud-2022-03-31-adding-eslint8.md#migrating-your-configuration-files-to-use-eslint-8). (CY-5848)

## Product enhancements

-   Updated the design of the **Code patterns** page to make the currently selected tool more noticeable. (CY-6021)
-   Added support for the ESLint plugin [<span class="skip-vale">eslint-plugin-es</span>](https://github.com/mysticatea/eslint-plugin-es) to disallow the syntax of specific ECMAScript versions. (CY-5968)
-   Moved the code coverage setup page under the repository **Settings**, tab **Coverage**. The new page includes a list of the most recent coverage reports uploaded to Codacy to [help you troubleshoot your coverage setup](http://docs.codacy.com/v8.0/coverage-reporter/#uploading-coverage). (CY-5399)

## Bug fixes

-   Fixed a broken link in the notification emails sent to organization admins when new members ask to join an organization. (CY-5979)
-   Fixed an issue that prevented Codacy from listing GitHub repositories on the Repositories list. (CY-5935)
-   Fixed an issue that could cause the **Organization Overview** page to display pull requests with the wrong status under the **Most problematic** open pull requests tab. (CY-5872)
-   Now, the **Files** page always displays the **Coverage** column on repositories that have coverage set up, even if there's no coverage data for any of the displayed files. (CY-5555)
