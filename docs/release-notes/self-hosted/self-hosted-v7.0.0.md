# Self-hosted v7.0.0

These release notes are for [Codacy Self-hosted v7.0.0](https://github.com/codacy/chart/releases/tag/7.0.0){: target="_blank"}, released on April 4, 2022.

ðŸ“¢ [Visit the Codacy roadmap](https://roadmap.codacy.com) and <span class="skip-vale">let us know</span> your feedback on both new and planned product updates!

## Upgrading Codacy Self-hosted

Follow the steps below to upgrade to Codacy Self-hosted v7.0.0:

1.  Check the [release notes for all Codacy Self-hosted versions](../index.md#self-hosted) **between your current version and the most recent version** for breaking changes and follow the instructions provided <span class="skip-vale">carefully</span>.

1.  Follow the instructions to [upgrade your Codacy Self-hosted instance](https://docs.codacy.com/v7.0/chart/maintenance/upgrade/).

1.  Update your Codacy command-line tools to the versions with the Git tag `self-hosted-7.0.0`:

    -   [Codacy Analysis CLI](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-analysis-cli/releases/tag/self-hosted-7.0.0)
    -   [Codacy Coverage Reporter](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-coverage-reporter/releases/tag/self-hosted-7.0.0)

## Breaking changes

**If you're using GitLab** please review the roles of your team on GitLab [considering the new permissions for project Maintainers](http://docs.codacy.com/v7.0/organizations/roles-and-permissions-for-synced-organizations/).

GitLab defines Maintainers as [super-developers](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/gitlab-the-product/#permissions-in-gitlab){: target="_blank"}:

> They're able to push to <span class="skip-vale">master</span>, deploy to production. This role is often held by maintainers and engineering managers.

However, until now the Codacy permissions for this role were limited to the same as a Developer. This change addresses customer feedback towards having a more seamless integration between Codacy and GitLab.

!!! note
    After upgrading Codacy, we recommend that you clean your browser cache and refresh the list of repositories on the **Repositories list** page to make sure that you're using the updated permissions:

## Product enhancements

-   GitLab project members with the Maintainer role can now perform the following operations on Codacy:

    -   Adding the project
    -   Configuring the project
    -   Changing the following analysis settings: ignoring issues and files, configuring code patterns, configuring file extensions, and managing branches

    [See the updated permissions](https://docs.codacy.com/v7.0/organizations/roles-and-permissions-for-synced-organizations/) for all GitLab roles. (CY-5876)

-   Included ESLint 8 as a new supported tool and deprecated ESLint 7.

    New repositories will use ESLint 7 by default, but **Codacy won't provide more updates for ESLint 7 and will remove ESLint 7 on April 4, 2023**. (CY-5848)

    !!! note
        Please [follow these troubleshooting instructions](https://docs.codacy.com/v7.0/chart/troubleshoot/troubleshoot/#missing-new-tools) if the new tool ESLint 8 doesn't appear on the **Code patterns** page of your repositories after upgrading to this Codacy Self-hosted version.

-   The [**Repositories list** page](https://docs.codacy.com/v7.0/organizations/managing-repositories/) now displays a warning icon to improve the visibility of warnings and errors affecting the repositories. (CY-5797)

-   The [**Overall quality** chart](https://docs.codacy.com/v7.0/organizations/organization-overview/#overall-quality-chart) now allows drilling down on the information to understand which repositories require attention to improve the organization's code quality. (CY-5580)

## Bug fixes
