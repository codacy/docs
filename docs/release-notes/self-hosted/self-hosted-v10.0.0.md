## Upgrading Codacy Self-hosted

Follow the steps below to upgrade to Codacy Self-hosted v10.0.0:

1.  Check the [release notes for all Codacy Self-hosted versions](../index.md#self-hosted) **between your current version and the most recent version** for breaking changes and follow the instructions provided <span class="skip-vale">carefully</span>.

1.  Follow the instructions to [upgrade your Codacy Self-hosted instance](https://docs.codacy.com/v10.0/chart/maintenance/upgrade/).

1.  Update your Codacy command-line tools to the versions with the Git tag `self-hosted-10.0.0`:

    -   [Codacy Analysis CLI](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-analysis-cli/releases/tag/self-hosted-10.0.0)
    -   [Codacy Coverage Reporter](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-coverage-reporter/releases/tag/self-hosted-10.0.0)

## Product enhancements

-   You can now configure your Codacy GitHub App to use [expiring user access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-github-apps/refreshing-user-to-server-access-tokens). (PLUTO-133)
-   The Status column of the [coverage reports list](https://docs.codacy.com/v10.0/coverage-reporter/#validating-coverage) now includes direct links to troubleshooting instructions when there are coverage errors. (IO-155)
-   Improved the performance and error handling of retrieving many open pull requests from the Git providers while populating the [**Pull requests** page](https://docs.codacy.com/v10.0/repositories/pull-requests/). (IO-133)
-   Codacy now displays the coverage variation metric with a precision of two decimal places on the [Repository Dashboard](../../repositories/repository-dashboard.md) and [Organization Overview](../../organizations/organization-overview.md), and you can [define quality gates](../../repositories-configure/adjusting-quality-settings.md#gates) with a coverage variation threshold using the same precision.

    The increased precision of the metric reflects the code coverage changes better by reducing issues with rounding errors.

    ![Coverage threshold with two decimal places on the Quality settings page](../images/io-56.png) (IO-56)
-   While [configuring a coding standard](../../organizations/using-a-coding-standard.md), you can now toggle all code patterns that are currently visible on the list using the new checkbox on the header. This allows you to conveniently toggle code patterns in bulk, for example, to enable all security code patterns. ![Selecting all code patterns while configuring a coding standard](../images/cy-6336.png) (CY-6336)
-   While [configuring a coding standard](../../organizations/using-a-coding-standard.md), you can now click the linkÂ **Enable/Disable all &lt;N&gt; patterns** to toggle all patterns matching the current filters, including the code patterns that weren't loaded on the list yet. (CY-6255)
-   Codacy now displays the coverage variation metric with a precision of two decimal places on the [Pull request](https://docs.codacy.com/v10.0/repositories/pull-requests/), [Commit](https://docs.codacy.com/v10.0/repositories/commits/), and [Files](https://docs.codacy.com/v10.0/repositories/files/) page, and you can [define quality gates](https://docs.codacy.com/v10.0/repositories-configure/adjusting-quality-settings/#gates) with a coverage variation threshold using the same precision.

    The increased precision of the metric reflects the code coverage changes better by reducing issues with rounding errors. ![Coverage variation on the Pull request quality overview](../images/io-92.png) (IO-92)
-   Codacy now supports the [client-side tool Unity Roslyn Analyzers](https://docs.codacy.com/v10.0/related-tools/local-analysis/client-side-tools/) for reporting error-prone and performance issues on C# projects that use the Unity framework. (IO-96)

## Bug fixes

-   Fix an issue where changing a parameter on a repository following a standard would not display a confirmation warning.  (PLUTO-149)
-   Added support for the ESLint plugin [prettier-plugin-tailwindcss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss). (CY-6570)
-   Added support for the ESLint plugin [eslint-plugin-typescript-sort-keys](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-typescript-sort-keys). (CY-6561)
-   Codacy-remark-lint uses now the plugin remark-gfm (CY-6513)
