# Self-hosted v6.0.0

These release notes are for [Codacy Self-hosted v6.0.0](https://github.com/codacy/chart/releases/tag/6.0.0){: target="_blank"}, released on March 2, 2022.

ðŸ“¢ [Visit the Codacy roadmap](https://roadmap.codacy.com) and <span class="skip-vale">let us know</span> your feedback on both new and planned product updates!

## Upgrading Codacy Self-hosted

Follow the steps below to upgrade to Codacy Self-hosted v6.0.0:

1.  Check the [release notes for all Codacy Self-hosted versions](../index.md#self-hosted) **between your current version and the most recent version** for breaking changes and follow the instructions provided <span class="skip-vale">carefully</span>.

1.  Follow the instructions to [upgrade your Codacy Self-hosted instance](https://docs.codacy.com/v6.0/chart/maintenance/upgrade/).

1.  Update your Codacy command-line tools to the versions with the Git tag `self-hosted-6.0.0`:

    -   [Codacy Analysis CLI](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-analysis-cli/releases/tag/self-hosted-6.0.0)
    -   [Codacy Coverage Reporter](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-coverage-reporter/releases/tag/self-hosted-6.0.0)

## Breaking changes

This version of Codacy Self-hosted introduces the following breaking changes:

-   Dropped support for Kubernetes 1.14 and MicroK8s 1.14

    Kubernetes 1.14 is an old version [first released in 2019](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/03/25/kubernetes-1-14-release-announcement/){: target="_blank"} that's no longer being maintained.

    If you're using Kubernetes 1.14 or MicroK8s 1.14, make sure that you upgrade your cluster before upgrading Codacy. For the current supported versions, see the [chart requirements page](https://docs.codacy.com/v6.0/chart/requirements/#kubernetes-or-microk8s-cluster-setup).

-   Removed the tool **PMD (Legacy)**

    For more details, see the [announcement for Codacy Cloud](../cloud/cloud-2022-02-16-pmd-legacy-removal.md).

    If you're currently using this tool to analyze your repositories and want to start using **PMD** instead, we recommend that you follow the next steps **before upgrading to this Codacy Self-hosted version**:

    1.  Take note of the code patterns that you have enabled on **PMD (Legacy)** and enable the corresponding code patterns on the new tool **PMD**.

        The new version of the tool includes different code patterns, so it's possible that not all code patterns will have a direct match on the new tool.

    1.  Disable **PMD (Legacy)** and enable **PMD**.

## Product enhancements

-   Now, Codacy calculates the new metric [diff coverage for pull requests](https://docs.codacy.com/v6.0/repositories/pull-requests/#pull-request-quality-overview). (CY-5533)

    It's also possible to [set up a quality gate rule](https://docs.codacy.com/v6.0/repositories-configure/adjusting-quality-settings/#gates) for diff coverage. (CY-5534)

-   Now, the [**Issues breakdown** area on the Repository Dashboard](https://docs.codacy.com/v6.0/repositories/repository-dashboard/#issues-breakdown) displays all issue categories, including **Code complexity**. (CY-5463)

-   You can now use the Codacy configuration file to [adjust how PMD CPD detects duplicated code](https://docs.codacy.com/v6.0/repositories-configure/codacy-configuration-file/#pmd-cpd-duplication), giving you more flexibility to eliminate false positives. (CY-5184)
