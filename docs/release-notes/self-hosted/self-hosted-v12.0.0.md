## Upgrading Codacy Self-hosted

Follow the steps below to upgrade to Codacy Self-hosted v12.0.0:

1.  Check the [release notes for all Codacy Self-hosted versions](../index.md#self-hosted) **between your current version and the most recent version** for breaking changes and follow the instructions provided <span class="skip-vale">carefully</span>.

1.  Follow the instructions to [upgrade your Codacy Self-hosted instance](https://docs.codacy.com/v12.0/chart/maintenance/upgrade/).

1.  Update your Codacy command-line tools to the following versions:

    -   [Codacy Analysis CLI 7.8.3](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-analysis-cli/releases/tag/7.8.3)
    -   [Codacy Coverage Reporter 13.10.15](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-coverage-reporter/releases/tag/13.10.15)

## Breaking changes

-   If you have set `scheduler.enable: "true"` in `values-production.yaml` (or `values-microk8s.yaml` if using MicroK8s), do the following before updating Kubernetes.

    Assuming you're using the default `codacy` namespace:

    1.  Remove all `scheduler.*` settings from `values-production.yaml` (or `values-microk8s.yaml` if using MicroK8s)

    1.  Update the ConfigMap of `codacy-worker-manager`:

        ```bash
        kubectl patch configmap/codacy-worker-manager --namespace codacy --type merge --patch '{"data":{"CONFIG_FORCE_codacy_kubernetes_scheduler_enable": "false","CONFIG_FORCE_codacy_kubernetes_scheduler_name":"default-scheduler"}}'
        ```

    1.  Restart the `codacy-worker-manager` Deployment:

        ```bash
        kubectl rollout restart deployment/codacy-worker-manager -n codacy
        ```

    1.  List any pending `worker` Pods:

        ```bash
        kubectl get pods -l app=worker --field-selector=status.phase=Pending -n codacy
        ```

    1.  If there are any pending `worker` Pods, remove them:

        !!! warning
            This is a destructive action. Make sure you understand the consequences.

        ```bash
        kubectl delete pods -l app=worker --field-selector=status.phase=Pending -n codacy
        ```

-   If you're upgrading your Kubernetes installation to v1.25, make sure to do the following in the recommended order to avoid service outages:

    1.  Upgrade to Codacy Self-hosted v12.0.0

    1.  If using the monitoring functionality [Grafana + Prometheus + Loki](https://docs.codacy.com/v12.0/chart/configuration/monitoring/#setting-up-monitoring-using-grafana-prometheus-and-loki), update Loki and Promtail by following the latest respective installation instructions ([Loki](https://docs.codacy.com/v12.0/chart/configuration/monitoring/#2-installing-loki), [Promtail](https://docs.codacy.com/v12.0/chart/configuration/monitoring/#3-installing-promtail)).

    1.  Upgrade Kubernetes to v1.25

## Product enhancements

-   Added support for [Kubernetes 1.24.\* and 1.25.\*](https://docs.codacy.com/v12.0/chart/requirements/#kubernetes-or-microk8s-cluster-setup) (REL-1304, REL-1306)
