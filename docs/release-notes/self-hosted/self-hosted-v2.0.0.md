# Self-hosted v2.0.0

These release notes are for [Codacy Self-hosted v2.0.0](https://github.com/codacy/chart/releases/tag/2.0.0), released on August 18, 2020.

To upgrade Codacy, follow [these instructions](../../chart/maintenance/upgrade.md).

## Breaking changes

This version of Codacy Self-hosted introduces the following breaking changes:

-   You must manually delete the existing RabbitMQ PVCs before upgrading Codacy.

    To do this, start by removing the RabbitMQ <span class="skip-vale">statefulset</span>:

    ```bash
    kubectl delete sts/codacy-rabbitmq-ha -n codacy
    ```

    Confirm the name of the PVCs that were created by RabbitMQ:

    ```bash
    kubectl get pvc -n codacy
    ```

    Finally, delete all the PVCs related to RabbitMQ. You should have three replicas which was the default for versions older than 2.0.0:

    ```bash
    kubectl delete pvc data-codacy-rabbitmq-ha-0 -n codacy
    kubectl delete pvc data-codacy-rabbitmq-ha-1 -n codacy
    kubectl delete pvc data-codacy-rabbitmq-ha-2 -n codacy
    ```

    !!! important
        After you upgrade Codacy, our chart will install a new version of RabbitMQ with the **new default of one replica**.

-   The structure of the file [`values-production.yaml`](https://docs.codacy.com/v2.0/chart/values-files/values-production.yaml) changed. You must update your version of the file to match the structure of the new file:

    -   The following analysis workers configuration values moved from:

        ```yaml
        worker-manager:
          config:
            workers:
                [...]
            workerResources:
                [...]
            pluginResources:
                [...]
        ```

        To:

        ```yaml
        global:
          workerManager:
            workers:
              config:
                [...]
                workerResources:
                    [...]
                pluginResources:
                    [...]
        ```

    -   The following database configuration values moved from:

        ```yaml
        hotspots-api:
          hotspotsdb:
            [...]
        
        activities:
          activitiesdb:
            [...]
        
        crow:
          crowdb:
            [...]
        ```

        To:

        ```yaml
        global:
          hotspotsdb:
            [...]
          activitiesdb:
            [...]
          crowdb:
            [...]
        ```

    -   The following Erlang cookie configuration was added to the RabbitMQ configuration values:

        ```yaml
        rabbitmq-ha:
          rabbitmqErlangCookie:  <--- erlang-cookie --->  # Generate one with `cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 32 | head -n 1`
          [...]
        ```

        When you previously installed Codacy, this cookie was automatically set to a random value. We recommend that you keep the same cookie to help ensure that the Codacy upgrade runs <span class="skip-vale">smoothly</span>.

        Run the following command to retrieve the current cookie value and define it explicitly in the new configuration:

        ```bash
        kubectl get secrets -n codacy codacy-rabbitmq-ha -o jsonpath="{.data.rabbitmq-erlang-cookie}" | base64 --decode
        ```
