1.  [Check the release notes](../index.md#self-hosted) for all Codacy Self-hosted versions between your current version and the most recent version for breaking changes and follow the instructions provided <span class="skip-vale">carefully</span>.

    !!! warning
        **Codacy Self-hosted v5.0.0 dropped the support for legacy manual organizations.** Please be sure to [review the breaking changes](self-hosted-v5.0.0.md#breaking-changes) introduced in that version before upgrading.

1.  Follow the instructions to [upgrade your Codacy Self-hosted instance](../../chart/maintenance/upgrade.md).

1.  Update your Codacy command-line tools to the versions with the Git tag `self-hosted-5.1.0`:

    -   [Codacy Analysis CLI](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-analysis-cli/releases/tag/self-hosted-5.1.0)
    -   [Codacy Coverage Reporter](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-coverage-reporter/releases/tag/self-hosted-5.1.0)

## Product enhancements

-   When connecting to email servers over SMTPS, Codacy now prefers to rely on TLSv1.2 over the deprecated TLSv1 or TLSv1.1 if the SMTP server allows it. (CY-5394)
-   It's now possible to [assign a coding standard automatically to new repositories](https://docs.codacy.com/v5.1/organizations/using-a-coding-standard/#set-default). (CY-5263)
-   The Codacy API now includes endpoints that allow you to [create and manage project API tokens programmatically](https://docs.codacy.com/v5.1/codacy-api/examples/creating-project-api-tokens-programmatically). This feature can be used to automate setting up coverage for either new repositories or for all your existing repositories. (CY-5090)
-   Now, all configurable Stylelint code patterns have [default values set to the recommended settings](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-stylelint/pull/240/files){: target="_blank"}, ensuring that they're ready to be used as soon as you enable them. (CY-3275)

## Bug fixes

-   Fixed an issue that prevented merge commits from displaying any information regarding files, duplication, and complexity. (CY-5364)
-   Fixed a scenario where the number of applied repositories on a coding standard didn't update when deleting a repository. (CY-5363)
-   Fixed a popup that overlapped the list on the People page. (CY-5282)
