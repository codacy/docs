## Upgrading Codacy Self-hosted

Follow the steps below to upgrade to Codacy Self-hosted v8.2.0:

1.  Check the [release notes for all Codacy Self-hosted versions](../index.md#self-hosted) **between your current version and the most recent version** for breaking changes and follow the instructions provided <span class="skip-vale">carefully</span>.

1.  Follow the instructions to [upgrade your Codacy Self-hosted instance](https://docs.codacy.com/v8.2/chart/maintenance/upgrade/).

1.  Update your Codacy command-line tools to the versions with the Git tag `self-hosted-8.2.0`:

    -   [Codacy Analysis CLI](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-analysis-cli/releases/tag/self-hosted-8.2.0)
    -   [Codacy Coverage Reporter](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-coverage-reporter/releases/tag/self-hosted-8.2.0)

## Product enhancements

-   The [GitHub integration](../../repositories-configure/integrations/github-integration.md) now uses a GitHub Apps token instead of a personal one so that the following features continue working even if the person who created the integration leaves the organization on GitHub:

    -   Analyzing new commits and pull requests
    -   Updating the status check of pull requests
    -   Suggesting changes
    -   Creating comments and issues on GitHub for issues detected by Codacy

    Additionally, all activity related to the GitHub integration features now appear as having been performed by Codacy instead of the person who created the integration. (PLUTO-36, PLUTO-77)

-   Added the new API endpoint [searchOrganizationRepositoriesWithAnalysis](https://api.codacy.com/api/api-docs#searchorganizationrepositorieswithanalysis) to allow searching for repositories in more advanced use cases. For now, it's possible to search for repositories filtered by a list of names. (PLUTO-45)

-   Codacy now displays the coverage variation metric with a precision of two decimal places on the [Pull request](../../repositories/pull-requests.md), [Commit](../../repositories/commits.md), and [Files](../../repositories/files.md) page, and you can [define quality gates](../../repositories-configure/adjusting-quality-settings.md#gates) with a coverage variation threshold using the same precision.

    The increased precision of the metric reflects the code coverage changes better by reducing the false changes due to rounding errors. (IO-54, IO-92, IO-93)

## Bug fixes

-   Fixed an issue that prevented changing code pattern configurations in a coding standard if Codacy added the code patterns only after the coding standard had been created. (PLUTO-37)
-   Improved the Codacy Analysis CLI output to provide better feedback when tools fail to run.

    Improved the error handling for the [Stylelint exit codes](https://stylelint.io/user-guide/usage/cli/#exit-codes).

    Fixed an issue in the Codacy Analysis CLI and the cloc metrics tool that made the tools fail when running for an empty set of files.

    Fixed an issue that caused PMD to fail when called in some modes. (IO-47)
-   Codacy now supports user accounts with email addresses containing the special characters specified in [RFC 5322](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5322#section-3.4.1). (PLUTO-73)
