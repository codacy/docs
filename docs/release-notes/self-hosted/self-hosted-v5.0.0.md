-   The Codacy components `codacy-activities`, `hotspots-api`, and `hotspots-worker` are no longer needed and were removed.

    Although the update process handles this change automatically by deleting the redundant pods from your cluster, it's recommended that after updating Codacy you manually delete:

    -   The databases `codacy-activities` and `hotspots` since they're no longer used.

    -   The following configuration file keys related to these components and their databases:

        ```text
        activities.*
        hotspots-api.*
        hotspots-worker.*
        global.activitiesdb.*
        global.hotspotsdb.*
        ```

## Product enhancements

-   Now, Codacy supports linting OpenAPI and AsyncAPI descriptions in either YAML or JSON files using [Spectral](https://stoplight.io/open-source/spectral/){: target="_blank"}. (CY-5088)

-   You can now [use an organization coding standard](https://docs.codacy.com/v5.0/organizations/using-a-coding-standard/) to apply the same coding best practices, conventions, or security rules to a group of repositories. (CY-4654)
