## Upgrading Codacy Self-hosted

Follow the steps below to upgrade to Codacy Self-hosted v11.0.0:

1.  Check the [release notes for all Codacy Self-hosted versions](../index.md#self-hosted) **between your current version and the most recent version** for breaking changes and follow the instructions provided <span class="skip-vale">carefully</span>.

1.  Follow the instructions to [upgrade your Codacy Self-hosted instance](https://docs.codacy.com/v11.0/chart/maintenance/upgrade/).

1.  Update your Codacy command-line tools to the versions with the Git tag `self-hosted-11.0.0`:

    -   [Codacy Analysis CLI](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-analysis-cli/releases/tag/self-hosted-11.0.0)
    -   [Codacy Coverage Reporter](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-coverage-reporter/releases/tag/self-hosted-11.0.0)

## Product enhancements

-   Codacy now displays the coverage variation metric with a precision of two decimal places on the [Pull request](https://docs.codacy.com/v11.0/repositories/pull-requests/), [Commit](https://docs.codacy.com/v11.0/repositories/commits/), and [Files](https://docs.codacy.com/v11.0/repositories/files/) page, and you can [define quality gates](https://docs.codacy.com/v11.0/repositories-configure/adjusting-quality-settings/#gates) with a coverage variation threshold using the same precision.

    The increased precision of the metric reflects the code coverage changes better by reducing issues with rounding errors. ![Coverage variation on the Pull request quality overview](../images/io-92.png) (IO-92)
