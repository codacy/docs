# Issues metrics

The **Issues metrics** dashboard provides an overview of all the issues detected in the repositories belonging to your Git provider organization. Here, you can navigate through the issues detected in your repositories and filter them by severity and category. You can also filter the issues by selecting specific repositories or using [the segments that you have set up](segments.md).

To access the Issues Metrics dashboard, select an organization from the top navigation bar and click on the **Open Issues** tab at the top of the page.

By default, the Issues Metrics dashboard displays metrics as the absolute number of issues. You can change the display to **Issues per 1,000 lines of code** by clicking on the ellipsis icon at the top right of the Open Issues tab. From here, you can also customize the period against which you want to compare the issues detected in your repositories. When available, comparisons against the previously selected period will be shown next to each value, and you can hover over the comparison to see the variation.
