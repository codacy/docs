# Segments
Segments are dimensions that Codacy reads from your provider that organizes repositories into relevant groups for you. Today, Segments is available for: [GitHub Custom Properties](#github-custom-properties)
  
<br><br>
### How can Segments be utilised?
- [Repository list](./managing-repositories/#custom-properties-filter) 
- [Security & Management Risk](./managing-security-and-risk/)

#### Enabling Segments
To enable **Segments**, an initial sync between your provider and Codacy needs to happen. Once completed, you can use **Segments** to better locate and organize repositories within Codacy.
<br>

#### Keep Segments in sync
For changes to repository **Custom Properties** in GitHub to be **automatically** reflected in Codacy, users need to [accept the new permission request made by the Codacy GitHub app](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/using-github-apps/approving-updated-permissions-for-a-github-app). Accepting this permission enables automatic synchronization of any future changes to the custom properties in GitHub.

!!! note
    If the permission is **not accepted**, users will still be able to use Repository Custom Properties as filters in Codacy, but will need to manually trigger a sync. This can be done using the **manual sync** button available in the filter dropdown, which allows users to synchronize changes from GitHub, though the process may take longer.

### GitHub Custom Properties {: id="github-custom-properties"}
Create, use, and manage custom properties for your repositories directly in GitHub. Custom properties allow you to assign tags or metadata to repositories, making it easier to categorize and filter them.
