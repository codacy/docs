# Organization Slack integration

<!-- TODO confirm that we only track Security issues -->

!!! tip
    If you want to receive notifications only for a specific repository, you can configure the [repository Slack integration](../../repositories-configure/integrations/slack-integration.md) instead.

This integration sends notifications to a Slack channel of your choice when Codacy detects new issues in your organization.

## Installing the Slack integration

To install the Slack integration:

1.  [Add a Slack Incoming Webhook](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) to your Slack workspace.

1.  Open your organization **Integrations**, page **Slack**, paste the incoming webhook in the field and click **Install Slack**.
