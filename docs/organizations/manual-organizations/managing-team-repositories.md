# Managing team repositories

You will be able to add and remove repositories from a team after it has been added to your organization.

## Adding a repository to your team

First, import a repository from your Git provider into your own account.

Go to your organization menu, select the team, then select the repository from the drop-down menu, and click on **Add repository**. This will make your organization the owner of this repository.
