# Authors vs members

With 'Synced Organizations', Codacy has introduced the concept of author. This article explains the main differences between an author and a member, and how a user can change from one to the other.

Regarding the analysis of commits, as soon as you [add an author](adding-and-managing-authors.md), Codacy analyzes all commits made with that email as if for a normal member. If your usual workflow doesn't include using the Codacy UI and instead you work with the information sent to the Git provider, being an author is the perfect fit for you.

On the other hand, if you're interested in the information available on the Codacy UI – whether it's about issues detected, patterns being used, or the current settings of a repository – you will have to become a member of the organization. To do so, click **Organizations** on the top right-hand menu under your avatar and you will see a list of organizations that you can join:

As soon as you join the organization, you will be added as a member and removed from the list of authors (if your email was there).

As a member, you can see the organization's repositories on Codacy, add new ones to be analyzed, and check the details of each repository.
