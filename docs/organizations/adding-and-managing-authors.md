# Adding and managing authors

Authors are a mechanism for inviting commit authors to your Codacy organization that aren't members of your organization. You might find yourself in a position where you want to analyze commits that were authored with redacted Git committer emails or bot-generated emails.

Under **Authors**, you will see people whose commits are being analyzed, in addition to the members of your organization. You will be charged for each author according to your plan.
