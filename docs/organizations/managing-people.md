## WIP Notes

<!-- Managing people in an organization -->

To see and manage the members of your organization on Codacy open your organization **Settings** and open **People**.

Members can add themselves to your Codacy organization when they log into Codacy using their Git provider credentials. On the **Plan and Billing** page there are different ways to control who can join your organization:

-   **Allow new people to join:** team members with access on the Git provider will be able to join the Codacy organization automatically and your billing will be updated accordingly.
-   **New people need to request access to join:** team members must request access to be able to join the Codacy organization. You can override this setting for organization owners.

Members can remove themselves from organizations, while owners can remove themselves as well as other users, even other owners. Organizations must have at least one owner.
