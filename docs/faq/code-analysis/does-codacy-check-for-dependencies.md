# Does Codacy check for dependencies?

Yes, Codacy scans the manifest files of your repositories and displays any vulnerable dependencies as issues in the [Security monitor](../../repositories/security-monitor.md).

For a list of supported languages and manifest files scanned by the Codacy dependency vulnerability scanning tools, see [Supported languages and tools](../../getting-started/supported-languages-and-tools.md).
