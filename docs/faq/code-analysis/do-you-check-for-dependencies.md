# Do you check for dependencies?

We don't check for dependencies. We do static code analysis on the source code, and that allows us to check code style, security duplication, complexity, and coverage.

To learn more on how to extend analysis on your repositories, see our [supported languages and tools](../../getting-started/supported-languages-and-tools.md).
