We only support Git repositories from the providers listed below.

On Codacy Cloud we support the following Git providers:

Besides these, on [Codacy self-hosted](https://www.codacy.com/self-hosted) we also support:

-   GitHub Enterprise (version 2.20.3 or later)
-   GitLab Enterprise (version 12.6.2-ee or later)

!!! note
    Although older versions of the self-hosted Git providers may work with Codacy without loss of functionality, Codacy will only fix issues and ensure compatibility with the versions listed above.
