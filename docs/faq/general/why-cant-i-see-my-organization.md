# Why can't I see my organization?

If you don't see your organization when [adding your organization on Codacy](../../organizations/what-are-synced-organizations.md#adding-an-organization), try the following steps:

1.  Make sure you have access to the organization with the account you're logged in.

1.  **If you're using GitHub** [install and authorize Codacy on your organization](https://github.com/apps/codacy-production/installations/new).

1.  Refresh the list of organizations on Codacy by clicking **refresh this list** on the Organizations page:

1.  Revoke Codacy's OAuth application on the Git provider website and log in again to Codacy.
