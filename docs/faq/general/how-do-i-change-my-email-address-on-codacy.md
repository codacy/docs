# How do I change my email address on Codacy?

Codacy will always pull email addresses from your current session in your Git provider. Your account email addresses are visible on your [Emails](https://app.codacy.com/account/notifications) page.

If you need to make any changes to the emails showing on Codacy, you will need to change this directly in your Git provider. Once you have done that, please log out and back in to Codacy.

If the changes are still not reflected on Codacy, go to your [access management](https://app.codacy.com/account/access-management) page and revoke the relevant Git provider or Google integration. After that, please log out and back in to Codacy with that provider.

If you're still having trouble changing your email addresses or have any other questions regarding this, please contact us at <mailto:support@codacy.com>.
