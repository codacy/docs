# How can I change or cancel my plan?

You can change or cancel [your Codacy plan](https://www.codacy.com/pricing) at any time. If you choose to cancel your annual subscription before the conclusion of the 12 months, your account will continue to work for the remainder of the annual billing period.

Codacy values feedback and we thank you in advance for letting us know the primary reason behind your decision to leave, whether budgetary constraints or missing deal-breaker functionality.

## If you're using Codacy Cloud

If you're using Codacy Cloud see [how to change the plan and billing of your Codacy organization](../../organizations/changing-your-plan-and-billing.md).

Alternatively, [delete your organization](../../organizations/what-are-synced-organizations.md#deleting-an-organization) to remove all its repositories from Codacy and cancel your existing plan.
