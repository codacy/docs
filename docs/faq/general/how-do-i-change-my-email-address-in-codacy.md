# How do I change my email address in Codacy?

Codacy will always pull email addresses from your current session in your Git provider. Your account's email addresses should be visible on your [email management](https://app.codacy.com/account/notifications) page.

If you need to make any changes to the emails showing in Codacy, you will need to change this directly in your Git provider. Once you have done that, please log out and back into Codacy.

If the changes are still not reflected in Codacy, go to your [access management](https://app.codacy.com/account/access-management) page and revoke the relevant Git provider or Google integration. After that, please log out and back into Codacy with that provider.

If you're still having trouble changing your email addresses or have any other questions regarding this, please contact us at <mailto:support@codacy.com>.
