# How does Codacy protect my privacy?

In May 2018 the new "General Data Protection Regulation" ([GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation)) came into effect. This regulation contains the most significant changes to European data privacy legislation in the last 20 years and gives you more control over your personal data and greater transparency on how it's used.

At Codacy, keeping your personal data safe has always been a top priority and we took GDPR as another opportunity for us to strengthen this commitment to you. We've changed our data processing policies, operations, activities, and documentation as a response to GDPR and have updated our [Privacy Policy](https://www.codacy.com/privacy) to incorporate said changes and specifically reflect the new regulation.

Below are some highlights of the updated policy:

-   Transparency: We've reworded our privacy policy for better navigation and to make it easier to read. Our policy outlines the type of personal data we collect, how we collect and process the data, and for what purposes. It also explains how we store, transfer, and share personal data, and our data retention practices
-   Control: Our policy now further explains the control you have over information about you and your online activities. At any time, you can request information, correction, deletion, or changes to your personal data or/and make changes yourself
-   GDPR: We've included additional language to discuss rights for users located in the European Union (EU)
