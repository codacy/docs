# I moved my repository on the Git provider

Currently, Codacy does not automatically detect moves of repositories between two organizations.

To ensure that Codacy continues to analyze a repository that was moved to another organization on your Git provider:

1.  Delete the repository from the original organization on Codacy, taking note of the settings for this repository
2.  Add the repository to the new organization on Codacy and reconfigure the repository with the same settings as the original one

If you cannot find your repository in the original Codacy organization or if you need more help with this process, please contact us at <mailto:support@codacy.com>.
