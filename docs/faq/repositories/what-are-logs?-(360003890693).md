# What are Logs?

On the Organization Dashboard and Repository Dashboard you have a section called **Logs** where you can see what is going on with your organization and repositories: disabled tools, patterns ignored, etc.

## How does it look?

On the Organization and Repository Dashboards you can see a section with the 10 most recent activities. It's not possible to dismiss these logs.

## What types of Logs can you find?

We have started with a short-list of logs and we will improve this feature based on the feedback we receive so please share your suggestions to ensure we are displaying the right activity logs.

For now, we have implemented:

| Type of Log (Activity)                                       | Where will you see it?                                |
