# Cancelling your plan

If ever you need to mosey on, we're here to help. We kindly ask you to send us a message and we'll swiftly process the cancellation.
 
If you choose to cancel your annual subscription before the 12 months conclude, your account will continue to work for the remainder of the annual billing period. 

We value feedback. Thanks in advance for letting us know the primary reason behind your decision to leave, whether budgetary constraints or missing deal-breaker functionality. 🙏
