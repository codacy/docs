# Why isn't Codacy commenting on pull requests anymore?

There are various reasons for Codacy to stop commenting on pull requests. The most common are that the user who enabled the integration no longer has permissions on the repository or that the SSH key is no longer valid. We recommend having a user with admin permissions on the repository recreate the integration in Codacy.

If you still have any problems, please contact us at <mailto:support@codacy.com>.
