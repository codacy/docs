# Why is my file missing?

In your repository's **Files** page you can view all the files that Codacy detected in your repository:

![Repository files](images/repository-files.png)

While all of the files in your repository should be displayed here, here is a list of reasons why some files might be missing:

-   **You are viewing the incorrect branch**

    In the Files view you can pick which branch is being displayed at any given time, and sometimes not all files exist in all branches.

-   **The file has an extension that is not on the list of supported extensions**

    Codacy has a default set of extensions that will associate to each language. Any file that has an extension that does not match any of those on the list will not appear in Codacy. You can find detailed information [here](../../repositories-configure/file-extensions.md) on how to configure this list.

-   **The file might have been ignored**

    Codacy allows you to ignore files that should not be analyzed. Those files will not be displayed on the UI. You can find more details on how to ignore files [here](../../repositories-configure/ignore-files-from-codacy-analysis.md).

-   **The file might be too big**

    Codacy will only display files up to 150 KB. Read about the [file size limitation on Codacy Cloud](#file-size-limitation-on-codacy-cloud) for more information.

## File size limitation on Codacy Cloud

Codacy Cloud currently does not analyze files that are above 150 KB in size. Larger files are not displayed on Codacy nor taken into account when grading your repository.

### Why is there a limit?

As part of our performance improvement measures, we spent time breaking down our total time it takes to analyze a file and found that a large percentage was focused on files that did not add value to our users. Those files tend to be the biggest in the repository and mostly generated by or dependent on a third-party. It increased analysis time significantly due to the file size and even resulted in time-outs at some point, preventing the real issues from being flagged.

As a solution to this problem, we placed a size limit to the files that Codacy would analyze. This decreased the average analysis time and the number of timeouts hence improving overall performance for our users.

### What if I really need a file analyzed that is over this limit?

While Codacy will discard your file by default, you can still have it analyzed using our [CLI](../../related-tools/run-local-analysis.md) and running the analysis locally. CLI does not have a set timeout or any limitation on file size, so you will be able to have your files analyzed this way.

### What about Self-hosted instances?

By default, Codacy Self-hosted has the same limit of 150 KB as our Cloud version but it's configurable because the resource allocation for on-premise instances is left up to each organization.

The change can be done on the Configuration panel:
