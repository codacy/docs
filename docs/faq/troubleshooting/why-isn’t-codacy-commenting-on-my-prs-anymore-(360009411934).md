# Why isn't Codacy commenting on my PRs anymore?

There are various reasons for Codacy to stop commenting on PRs. The most common are that the user who enabled the integration no longer has permissions on the repo or that the SSH key is no longer valid. We recommend having a user with admin permissions on the repo recreate the integration in Codacy.

If you still have any problems, please contact us.
