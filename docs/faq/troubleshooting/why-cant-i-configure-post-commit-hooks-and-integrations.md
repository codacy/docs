# Why can't I configure post-commit hooks and integrations?

Have you added your repository manually (via URL)? In that case, Codacy won't allow the integration to be added, causing the issue with post-commit hooks. To get this sorted, you will have to remove your repository and re-add it via our wizard page. 

If you're still unable to configure the integration, please contact us at <mailto:support@codacy.com>.
