# How do I change my email address in Codacy?

Codacy will always pull email addresses from your current session in your Git provider. Your account's email addresses should be visible on your [Codacy account settings page](https://www.codacy.com/account). 

If you need to make any changes to the emails showing in Codacy, you will need to change this directly in your git provider. Once you have done that, please log out and back into Codacy.

If the changes are still not reflected in Codacy, go to [Your Account](https://www.codacy.com/account) page and revoke the relevant Git provider or Google integration. After that, please log out and back into Codacy with that provider.

If you are still having troubles changing your emails or have any other question regarding this, reach out to us.
