# Overview

Codacy Guardrails is a brand new way of enforcing code security and quality standards for AI-generated code, built into the free Codacy IDE Extension for VSCode, Copilot, Cursor, and Windsurf. Guardrails helps developers ship safer, cleaner AI code by applying best practices and blocking insecure patterns â€“ while the code is being generated. 

Besides real-time AI code scanning, Guardrails users can now prompt all their Codacy findings, without ever leaving the AI chat panel inside their IDE.
