# Limitations

## Manual installation using NPM package
If you prefer the manual installation, the AI doesn't automatically analyse the code generated unless there's a rule set for it to do so. When using the IDE extension (VS Code, Cursor or Windsurf), we create those AI rules for the workspace, but if you are installing the MCP manually, you will need to create those rules by yourself. Let us know if you you plan to use this approach, so we can provide more information.


## Limitations with Windows

Windows WSL (a feature that allows you to run a Linux environment directly on Windows, without the need for a virtual machine or dual-boot setup) is the only way you can use this feature for now, but we're still working to fully support Windows.
