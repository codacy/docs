## Product Enhancements

Synced organizations for GitHub are live!

This feature will allow for easier integration with GitHub and
organization management. HereÂ you can find our [documentation on the new
features and how to use
them](https://support.codacy.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010263720).

As a consequence, the next time you log in to Codacy you will see a
window asking for one additional permission on GitHub with this
information:

This will allow us to create an organization hook on GitHub for the new
Synced organizations that will notify us whenever changes occur on
GitHub.
