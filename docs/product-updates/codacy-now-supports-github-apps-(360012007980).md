# Codacy now supports GitHub Apps

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are changing the way you authenticate
to Codacy with GitHub: Starting February 2020, when you sign in, you'll
be prompted to use GitHub Apps.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">GitHub Apps are the new preferred way of
building products that work with GitHub repositories. Unlike right now,
where you must grant access to everything in your account, with Apps
you'll be able to select which accounts, organizations and repositories
Codacy has access to. You can also grant access to more later. If you
previously wanted to grant access to only one of your organizations or
only a specific repository, Apps will have you covered.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Using Apps also unlocks access to new
APIs, like GitHub Checks for creating better pull request
reviews.</span>![ghapps.gif](https://support.codacy.com/hc/article_attachments/360009269879/ghapps.gif)

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To migrate to Apps all you have to do is
sign out, sign in to Codacy and follow the wizard requesting the new
permissions. Existing integrations will continue to work.</span>
