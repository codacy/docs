# Language Extensions

If your repository has source files with unrecognized extensions, you
can force Codacy to include them in the next repository analysis. To do
so, go to your repository's **Settings**&gt;**File Extensions**

Extensions</span>](/hc/en-us/article_attachments/207541949/Screen_Shot_2016-10-14_at_12.00.47.png)

 

To change it, add the extensions you want to be recognized for each
language. 

After clicking **Save**, you will be given the opportunity to retry the
most recent commit with the new settings. To do this, click on the
option **Analyze now** that appears in the footer of the screen:
