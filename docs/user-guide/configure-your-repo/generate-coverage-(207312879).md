# Generate Coverage

Code coverage is a metric used to describe the degree to which the source code of a program is tested.

A program with high code coverage has been more thoroughly tested and has a lower chance of containing software bugs than a program with low code coverage.

There are many tools to generate coverage. We have a few suggestions:

- Java - [JaCoCo](http://eclemma.org/jacoco)
- JavaScript - [Istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul)
- PHP - [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de)
- Python - [Coverage.py](http://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- C\# - [OpenCover](https://github.com/OpenCover/opencover/) and [dotCover](https://www.jetbrains.com/dotcover/)
- Scala - [Scoverage](https://github.com/scoverage/scalac-scoverage-plugin)
- Ruby - [SimpleCov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov)
