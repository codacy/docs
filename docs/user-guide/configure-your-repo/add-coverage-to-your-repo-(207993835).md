# Add coverage to your repo

You can configure repositories to show code coverage reports directly in
Codacy.

Follow [this
guide](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-coverage-reporter#setup) to set
up code coverage for your repository.

If your report format is not yet supported check some of the community's
projects, e.g., [schrej/godacov](https://github.com/schrej/godacov), or
contribute to our
[coverage-parser](https://github.com/codacy/coverage-parser) project.

We also support partial coverage reports. See
[here](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-coverage-reporter#updating-codacy) on
how to send multiple coverage reports for the same language.
