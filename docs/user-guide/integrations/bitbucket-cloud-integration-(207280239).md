# Bitbucket Cloud Integration

If you're seeing a warning about your Bitbucket Cloud integration being
disabled you will need to enable it again by going to your
repository **Settings** -&gt; **Integrations**. Please note that you
need to have Admin permissions in both Codacy and Bitbucket Cloud to do
this. 

Once the integration is done, Codacy will restart analysing your
repository and you can add some other useful feature such as pull
request status, comments or summary directly in Bitbucket Cloud.

For private repositories, this user will by default become the Bitbucket
Cloud user that Codacy will use to comment and create issues on
Bitbucket Cloud. For public repositories, comments made by Codacy will
appear as coming from codacy-bot.

Be aware that when clicking "Enable", you will be required to move back
and forth between Codacy and Bitbucket Cloud if additional permissions
are required.

After enabling the Bitbucket Cloud integration, you will have additional
options when browsing the existing issues on the repository:
