# Updates to Codacy’s Privacy Policy

On the 25th of May 2018, the new “General Data Protection Regulation”
([GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation))
will come into effect. This regulation contains the most significant
changes to European data privacy legislation in the last 20 years and
gives you more control over your personal data and greater transparency
on how it is used.

At Codacy, keeping your personal data safe has always been a top
priority and we look at GDPR as another opportunity for us to strengthen
this commitment to you. We are changing our data processing policies,
operations, activities and documentation in anticipation of the upcoming
GDPR and have updated our [Privacy
Policy](https://www.codacy.com/privacy) to incorporate said changes and
specifically reflect the new regulation.

The updated policy takes effect immediately for all of Codacy’s
customers and users. Below are some change highlights:

-   Transparency: We’ve reworded our privacy policy for better
    navigation and to make it easier to read. Our policy outlines the
    type of personal data we collect, how we collect and process the
    data, and for what purposes. It also explains how we store,
    transfer, and share personal data, and our data retention practices
-   Control: Our policy now further explains the control you have over
    information about you and your online activities. At any time, you
    can request information, correction, deletion or changes to your
    personal data or/and make changes yourself
-   GDPR: We’ve included additional language to discuss rights for users
    located in the European Union (EU)
