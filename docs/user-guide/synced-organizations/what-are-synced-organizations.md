# What are synced organizations

With synced organizations, your Git provider organizations and members will be automatically imported into Codacy. Changes to membership will reflect on Codacy real time and you can add new repositories to Codacy in one click.

By setting up a synced organization, you are avoiding having to deal with manual team and repository management, duplicate repositories, stuck repositories created with insufficient permissions and blocked pull request status due to overriding.

## Adding a synced organization

Organizations that can be added to Codacy show up on the Organizations list.

If you can't see the organization you are looking for, [find out what could be the possible reasons](/hc/en-us/articles/360010264500).

You can see and manage who joined your organization on Codacy in the People section.

There are different ways to control who can join your organization:

-   **Allow new people to join**: team members with access on the Git
      provider will be able to join Codacy automatically and your billing
      will be updated accordingly.
-   **New people request to join**: team members need to request access
      in order to be able to join Codacy. In can override this setting for
      organization owners.

## Updates on the Git provider

In case you change your organization or repository on the Git provider, they'll be reflected on Codacy. The following cases are supported: 

-   Changing the organization name
-   Changing a repository name
-   Changing a repository visibility
