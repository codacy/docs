# Adding and managing Authors

## What are Authors?

Authors are a mechanism for inviting commit authors to your Codacy organization that are not members of your organization. You might find yourself in a position where you want to analyze commits that were authored with redacted git committer emails or bot-generated emails.

Under Authors, you will see people whose commits are being analyzed, in addition to the members of your organization. You will be charged for each Author according to your plan.

You can add Authors in the People section of your organization settings or directly on a Pull request page.
